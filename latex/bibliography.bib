In this paper, we propose a model for enabling data-sensitive navigation for user-interface elements. This model is applied to normalize the user input according to the visual change, and also to visually communicate this normalization. In this way, the exploration of heterogeneous data using common interaction elements can be performed in an efficient way. We apply our model to the field of medical visualization and present guided navigation tools for traversing vascular structures and for camera rotation around 3D volumes. The presented examples demonstrate that the model scales to user-interface elements where multiple parameters are set simultaneously.},

This is especially challenging when the global data range is not known in advance, as is often the case in remote and in-situ visualization settings. Since the data range may vary dramatically as the simulation progresses, volume rendering using local transfer functions may not be coherent for all time steps. We present an exploratory technique that enables coherent classification of time-varying volume data. Unlike previous approaches, which require pre-processing of all time steps, our approach lets the user explore the transfer function space without accessing the original 3D data. This is useful for interactive visualization, and absolutely essential for in-situ visualization, where the entire simulation data range is not known in advance. Our approach generates a compact representation of each time step at rendering time in the form of ray attenuation functions, which are used for subsequent operations on the opacity and color mappings. The presented approach offers interactive exploration of time-varying simulation data that alleviates the cost associated with reloading and caching large data sets.},

For high-precision floating-point data, compressing the data solely based on values can only achieve a limited saving. Further reduction is possible with the fact that usually only a smaller subset of the data is of interest in analysis. In this paper, we present an application-driven approach to compressing large-scale time-varying volume data. Our method identifies a reference feature to partition the data into space-time blocks, which are compressed with various precisions depending on their association to the feature. Runtime decompression is performed with bit-wise texture packing and deferred filtering. We show that our method achieves high compression rates and interactive rendering while preserving fine details surrounding regions of interest. Such an application-driven approach points us to a promising direction for coping with the large data problems facing computational scientists.},

However, current object-space partitioning schemes for parallel rendering can make load imbalance across processors very severe. This work provides an alternative based on wavelet theory.

	abstract = {The most important technique to visualize {3D} scalar data, as they arise e.g. in medicine from tomographic measurement, is direct volume rendering. A transfer function maps the scalar values to optical properties which are used to solve the integral of light transport in participating media. Many medical data sets, especially {MRI} data, however, are difficult to visualize due to different tissue types being represented by the same scalar value. The main problem is that interesting structures will be occluded by less important structures because they share the same range of data values. Occlusion, however, is a view-dependent problem and cannot be solved easily by transfer function design. This paper proposes a new method to display different entities inside the volume data in a single rendering pass. The proposed opacity peeling technique reveals structures in the data set that cannot be visualized directly by one-or multi-dimensional transfer functions without explicit segmentation.

	abstract = {Volume Visualization is the process of displaying volumetric data represented as sample points on a regular or irregular {3D} grid. The data is currently produced by medical scanners such as {MRI}, {CT}, etc, and by numerical methods such as scientific simulations. Techniques that have been proposed for this purpose over the years include direct volume-rendering which seeks to capture a visual impression of the complete {3D} dataset by accounting for the emission and light absorption effects of all the data elements. This technique is effective when rendering volumes of space-filling gasses or volumes composed of many micro-surfaces, such as tissue in medical datasets. We have focused our efforts on Point-Based Volume rendering and specifically on the image-aligned post-shaded splatting algorithm which was proposed as a remedy to the drawbacks of existing algorithms with special focus on image quality. In the course of this dissertation, we will follow the evolution of this algorithm through several stages of maturity. Our contributions to this algorithm include the ability to render efficient grid topologies with significant storage and rendering time gains for both {3D} as well as time-varying datasets. We have also proposed a post-convolved volume rendering technique to accelerate magnified viewing. The framework has been ported to a hardware-accelerated implementation that has the ability to interactively slice point based volumes and was optimized to take full advantage of the splatting algorithm's inherent advantages for empty-space skipping and early splat elimination. Finally, we have generalized our framework for the interactive rendering of irregular datasets consisting of ellipsoidal kernels of arbitrary size and orientation. Our suggested algorithm outperforms existing hardware approaches by about an order of magnitude in terms of throughput. Different modeling approaches have been explored for encoding the data using either {RBF} (Radial Basis Functions) or {EBF} (Elliptical Basis Functions), and new methods are proposed for ongoing/future work. The final goal is a truly general point-based hardware-accelerated framework for the interactive visualization of both regular and irregular volumetric data in high-fidelity.},

In particular, the specification of the transfer function-the mapping from data values to renderable optical properties-is frequently a time consuming and unintuitive task. Ideally, the data being visualized should itself suggest an appropriate transfer function that brings out the features of interest without obscuring them with elements of little importance. We demonstrate that this is possible for a large class of scalar volume data, namely that where the regions of interest are the boundaries between different materials. A transfer function which makes boundaries readily visible can be generated from the relationship between three quantities: the data value and its first and second directional derivatives along the gradient direction. A data structure we term the histogram volume captures the relationship between these quantities throughout the volume in a position independent, computationally efficient fashion. We describe the theoretical importance of the quantities measured by the histogram volume, the implementation issues in its calculation, and a method for semiautomatic transfer function generation through its analysis. We conclude with results of the method on both idealized synthetic data as well as real world datasets.},

However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional transfer functions for scalar data (based on data value, gradient magnitude, and a second directional derivative), and describes a set of direct manipulation widgets which make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient.

Though they have not received widespread attention, multidimensional transfer functions are a very effective way to extract materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional transfer functions for scalar data, and describes the application of multidimensional transfer functions to multivariate data. We present a set of direct manipulation widgets that make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient. We also describe how to use modern graphics hardware to both interactively render with multidimensional transfer functions and to provide interactive shadows for volumes.

In order to generate time-varying transfer functions, we search the data for classes that have similar behavior over time, assuming that data points that behave similarly belong to the same feature. We utilize a method we call temporal clustering and sequencing to find dynamic features in value space and create a corresponding transfer function. First, clustering finds groups of data points that have the same value space activity over time. Then, sequencing derives a progression of clusters over time, creating chains that follow value distribution changes. Finally, the cluster sequences are used to create transfer functions, as sequences describe the value range distributions over time in a data set.},

A fairly recent trend to enhance the expressiveness of scientific visualization is to produce depictions of physical phenomena taking inspiration from traditional handcrafted illustrations: this approach is known as illustrative visualization, and it is getting a foothold in flow visualization as well.

The presented focus+context approach removes or suppresses less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. However, less important parts are fully visible in those regions, where important visual information is not lost, i.e., more relevant features are not occluded. Features within the volumetric data are first classified according to a new dimension, denoted as object importance. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. Next, for each feature, various representations (levels of sparseness) from a dense to a sparse depiction are defined. Levels of sparseness define a spectrum of optical properties or rendering styles. The resulting image is generated by ray-casting and combining the intersected features proportional to their importance (importance compositing). The paper includes an extended discussion on several possible schemes for levels of sparseness specification. Furthermore, different approaches to importance compositing are treated.},

	abstract = {The use of multi-dimensional transfer functions for direct volume rendering has been shown to be an effective means of extracting materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. The most common multi-dimensional transfer function consists of a two-dimensional ({2D)} histogram with axes representing a subset of the feature space (e.g., value vs. value gradient magnitude), with each entry in the {2D} histogram being the number of voxels at a given feature space pair. Users then assign color and opacity to the voxel distributions within the given feature space through the use of interactive widgets (e.g., box, circular, triangular selection). Unfortunately, such tools lead users through a trial-and-error approach as they assess which data values within the feature space map to a given area of interest within the volumetric space. In this work, we propose the addition of non-parametric clustering within the transfer function feature space in order to extract patterns and guide transfer function generation. We apply a non-parametric kernel density estimation to group voxels of similar features within the {2D} histogram. These groups are then binned and colored based on their estimated density, and the user may interactively grow and shrink the binned regions to explore feature boundaries and extract regions of interest. We also extend this scheme to temporal volumetric data in which time steps of {2D} histograms are composited into a histogram volume. A three-dimensional ({3D)} density estimation is then applied, and users can explore regions within the feature space across time without adjusting the transfer function at each time step. Our work enables users to effectively explore the structures found within a feature space of the volume and provide a context in which the user can understand how these structures relate to their volumetric data. We provide tools for enhanced exploration and manipulation of the transfer function, and we show that the initial t ransfer function generation serves as a reasonable base for volumetric rendering, reducing the trial-and-error overhead typically found in transfer function design.},

We exploit flow field properties such as velocity, gradient, curl, helicity, and divergence using vector calculus methods to define an {MDTF} that can be used to extract and track features in a flow field. We show how the defined {MDTF} can be applied to interactive {3D} flow visualization by combining them with state-of-the-art texture-based flow visualization of steady and unsteady fields. We demonstrate that {MDTFs} can be used to help alleviate the problem of occlusion, which is one of the main inherent drawbacks of {3D} texture-based flow visualization techniques.

The design of them mostly depends on the user's experience and thus remains a challenge. Therefore, we present an approach in this paper to automate the transfer function design based on 2D density plots. By exploiting their smoothness, we adopted the Morse theory to automatically decompose the feature space into a set of valley cells. We design a simplification process based on cell separability to eliminate cells which are mainly caused by noise in the original volume data. Boundary persistence is first introduced to measure the separability between adjacent cells and to suitably merge them. Afterward, a reasonable classification result is achieved where each cell represents a potential feature in the volume data. This classification procedure is automatic and facilitates an arbitrary number and shape of features in the feature space. The opacity of each feature is determined by its persistence and size. To further incorporate the user's prior knowledge, a hierarchical feature representation is created by successive merging of the cells. With this representation, the user is allowed to merge or split features of interest and set opacity and color freely. Experiments on various volumetric data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach in transfer function generation.},

Many computational visualization techniques have had only limited success in succinctly portraying the structure of three-dimensional turbulent flow. Motivated by both the extensive history and success of illustration and photographic flow visualization techniques, we have developed a new interactive volume rendering and visualization system for flows and volumes that simulates and enhances traditional illustration, experimental advection, and photographic flow visualization techniques. Our system uses a combination of varying focal and contextual illustrative styles, new advanced two-dimensional transfer functions, enhanced Schlieren and shadowgraphy shaders, and novel oriented structure enhancement techniques to allow interactive visualization, exploration, and comparative analysis of scalar, vector, and time-varying volume datasets. Both traditional illustration techniques and photographic flow visualization techniques effectively reduce visual clutter by using compact oriented structure information to convey three-dimensional structures. Therefore, a key to the effectiveness of our system is using one-dimensional (Schlieren and shadowgraphy) and two-dimensional (silhouette) oriented structural information to reduce visual clutter, while still providing enough three-dimensional structural information for the user's visual system to understand complex three-dimensional flow data. By combining these oriented feature visualization techniques with flexible transfer function controls, we can visualize scalar and vector data, allow comparative visualization of flow properties in a succinct, informative manner, and provide continuity for visualizing time-varying datasets.},

Our approach was developed by a mixed team of visualization and domain experts. To better understand these systems, and to explore their representation in {NWP} models, we use a variety of illustration-inspired techniques to visualize their structure and time evolution. Illustration-inspired techniques aid in the identification of the amount of vertical wind shear in a hurricane, which can help meteorologists predict dissipation. Illustration-style visualization, in combination with standard visualization techniques, helped explore the vortex rollup phenomena and the mesovortices contained within. We evaluated the effectiveness of our visualization with the help of six hurricane experts. The expert evaluation showed that the illustration-inspired techniques were preferred over existing tools.

We evaluated the effectiveness of these illustrative techniques by conducting a user study. We compared the ability of subjects to visually track features using snapshots, snapshots augmented by illustration techniques, animations, and animations augmented by illustration techniques. User accuracy, time required to perform a task, and user confidence were used as measures to evaluate the techniques. The results indicate that the use of illustration-inspired techniques provides a significant improvement in user accuracy and the time required to complete the task.

	abstract = {Traditionally, time-varying data has been visualized using snapshots of the individual time steps or an animation of the snapshots shown in a sequential manner. For larger datasets with many time-varying features, animation can be limited in its use, as an observer can only track a limited number of features over the last few frames. Visually inspecting each snapshot is not practical either for a large number of time-steps. We propose new techniques inspired from the illustration literature to convey change over time more effectively in a time-varying dataset. Speedlines are used extensively by cartoonists to convey motion, speed, or change over different panels. Flow ribbons are another technique used by cartoonists to depict motion in a single frame. Strobe silhouettes are used to depict previous positions of an object to convey the previous positions of the object to the user. These illustration-inspired techniques can be used in conjunction with animation to convey change over time.},

This way, the vector field contours are a particular set of isolated stream line segments that depend on the view direction and few additional parameters. We present an analysis of the usefulness of vector field contours by demonstrating their application to linear vector fields. In order to achieve interactive visualization, we develop an efficient GPU-based implementation for real-time extraction and rendering of vector field contours.

In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework that combines the advantages of clustering methods and illustrative rendering techniques to generate a concise and informative depiction of complex flow structures. Given a 3D vector field, we first generate a number of streamlines covering the important regions based on an entropy measurement. Then we decompose the streamlines into different groups based on a categorization of vector information, wherein the streamline pattern in each group is ensured to be coherent or nearly coherent. For each group, we select a set of representative streamlines and render them in an illustrative fashion to enhance depth cues and succinctly show local flow characteristics. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate a visualization that is relatively free of visual clutter while facilitating perception of salient information of complex vector fields.},

Based on a fast illuminated streamlines algorithm, standard graphics hardware is sufficient to gain interactive rendering rates. Our approach does not require the user to have any prior knowledge of flow features. After the streamlines are computed in a short preprocessing time, the user can interactively change appearance and density of the streamlines to further explore the flow. Most important flow features like velocity or pressure not only can be mapped to all available streamline appearance properties like streamline width, material, opacity, but also to streamline density. To improve spatial perception of the {3D} flow we apply techniques based on animation, depth cueing, and halos along a streamline if it is crossed by another streamline in the foreground. Finally, we make intense use of focus+context methods like magic volumes, region of interest driven streamline placing, and spotlights to solve the occlusion problem.},

Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated stream lines within an interactive visualization environment.},

Although researchers have developed some automatic techniques for transfer-function specification, the exploration process still requires users to tune the parameters manually until they can produce the desired visualization. Researchers have conducted substantial work to assist users in this specification task by providing interactive widgets. These tools generally assist users by letting them create and manipulate widgets over one or more dimensions of histogram information representing the data.

In this article we present the state of the art in feature-based flow visualisation techniques. We will present numerous feature extraction techniques, categorised according to the type of feature.

Our texture-based technique tracks various features individually and then uses the tracked objects to better visualize structural changes. We show the effectiveness of our texture-based tracking technique with both synthetic and real world time-varying data. Furthermore, we highlight the specific visualization, annotation, registration, and feature isolation benefits of our technique.

	abstract = {Exploring and analyzing the temporal evolution of features in large-scale time-varying datasets is a common problem in many areas of science and engineering. One natural representation of such data is tracking graphs, i.e., constrained graph layouts that use one spatial dimension to indicate time and show the “tracks” of each feature as it evolves, merges or disappears. However, for practical data sets creating the corresponding optimal graph layouts that minimize the number of intersections can take hours to compute with existing techniques. Furthermore, the resulting graphs are often unmanageably large and complex even with an ideal layout. Finally, due to the cost of the layout, changing the feature definition, e.g. by changing an iso-value, or analyzing properly adjusted sub-graphs is infeasible. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new framework that couples hierarchical feature definitions with progressive graph layout algorithms to provide an interactive exploration of dynamically constructed tracking graphs. Our system enables users to change feature definitions on-the-fly and filter features using arbitrary attributes while providing an interactive view of the resulting tracking graphs. Furthermore, the graph display is integrated into a linked view system that provides a traditional 3D view of the current set of features and allows a cross-linked selection to enable a fully flexible spatio-temporal exploration of data. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with several large-scale scientific simulations from combustion science.},

Machine learning has received great success in both data mining and computer graphics; surprisingly, the study of systematic ways to employ machine learning in making visualization is meager. Like human learning, we can make a computer program learn from previous input data to optimize its performance on processing new data. In the context of visualization, the use of machine learning can potentially free us from manually sifting through all the data. This paper describes intelligent visualization designs for three different applications: (1) volume classification and visualization, (2) {4D} flow feature extraction and tracking, (3) network scan characterization.},

	doi = {10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2009.4906831},
	abstract = {To analyze time-varying data sets, tracking features over time is often necessary to better understand the dynamic nature of the underlying physical process. Tracking 3D time-varying features, however, is non-trivial when the boundaries of the features cannot be easily defined. In this paper, we propose a new framework to visualize time-varying features and their motion without explicit feature segmentation and tracking. In our framework, a time-varying feature is described by a time series or time activity curve (TAC). To compute the distance, or similarity, between a voxel's time series and the feature, we use the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance metric. The purpose of DTW is to compare the shape similarity between two time series with an optimal warping of time so that the phase shift of the feature in time can be accounted for. After applying DTW to compare each voxel's time series with the feature, a time-invariant distance field can be computed. The amount of time warping required for each voxel to match the feature provides an estimate of the time when the feature is most likely to occur. Based on the TAC-based distance field, several visualization methods can be derived to highlight the position and motion of the feature. We present several case studies to demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of our framework.},

We introduce the {TransGraph}, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The {TransGraph} not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking. The user interacts with the {TransGraph} and makes connection to the volumetric data through brushing and linking. A set of intuitive queries is provided to enable knowledge extraction from time-varying data.

However, as the resolution of the simulation becomes higher, the number of features to track increases and so does the cost in large-scale simulations. Since many of these features act in groups, it seems more cost-effective to follow groups of features rather than individual ones. Very little work has been done for tracking groups of features. In this paper, we present the first full group tracking framework in which we track groups (clusters) of features in time-varying {3D} fluid flow simulations.

To identify the temporal trends from a local region, we design a new algorithm called {SUBDTW} to estimate when a trend appears and vanishes in a given time series. Based on the beginning and ending times of the trends, their temporal relationships can be modeled as a state machine representing the trend sequence. Since a scientific data set usually contains millions of data points, we propose an algorithm to extract important trend relationships in linear time complexity. We design novel user interfaces to explore the trend relationships, to visualize their temporal characteristics, and to display their spatial distributions.

Extracted features often take much less storage space and computing resources to visualize. Most feature extraction and tracking methods first identify features of interest in each time step independently, then correspond these features in consecutive time steps of the data. Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on. Our method is low cost with very little storage overhead, and thus facilitates interactive or runtime extraction and visualization, unlike previous methods which were largely suited for batch-mode processing due to high computational cost.},

Pylyshyn examines how we see and how we visualize and why the scientific account does not align with the way these processes seem to us "from the inside." In doing so, he addresses issues in vision science, cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive {neuroscience.First}, Pylyshyn argues that there is a core stage of vision independent from the influence of our prior beliefs and examines how vision can be intelligent and yet essentially knowledge-free. He then proposes that a mechanism within the vision module, called a visual index (or {FINST)}, provides a direct preconceptual connection between parts of visual representations and things in the world, and he presents various experiments that illustrate the operation of this mechanism. He argues that such a deictic reference mechanism is needed to account for many properties of vision, including how mental images attain their apparent spatial character without themselves being laid out in space in our {brains.The} final section of the book examines the "picture theory" of mental imagery, including recent neuroscience evidence, and asks whether any current evidence speaks to the issue of the format of mental images. This analysis of mental imagery brings together many of the themes raised throughout the book and provides a framework for considering such issues as the distinction between the form and the content of representations, the role of vision in thought, and the relation between behavioral, neuroscientific, and phenomenological evidence regarding mental representations.},

We introduce the volume illustration approach, combining the familiarity of a physics-based illumination model with the ability to enhance important features using non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Since the features to be enhanced are defined on the basis of local volume characteristics rather than volume sample values, the application of volume illustration techniques requires less manual tuning than the design of a good transfer function. Volume illustration provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing the structural perception of volume models through the amplification of features and the addition of illumination effects},

The visibility histograms introduced by Correa and Ma reflect the effect of occlusion by measuring the influence of each sample in the histogram to the rendered image. However, the visibility is defined on individual samples, while volume exploration focuses on conveying the spatial relationships between features. Moreover, the high computational cost and large memory requirement limits its application in multi-dimensional transfer function {design.In} this paper, we extend visibility histograms to feature visibility, which measures the contribution of each feature in the rendered image. Compared to visibility histograms, it has two distinctive advantages for opacity specification. First, the user can directly specify the visibilities for features and the opacities are automatically generated using an optimization algorithm. Second, its calculation requires only one rendering pass with no additional memory requirement. This feature visibility based opacity specification is fast and compatible with all types of transfer function design. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step volume exploration scheme, in which an automatic optimization is first performed to provide a clear illustration of the spatial relationship and then the user adjusts the visibilities directly to achieve the desired feature enhancement. The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated by experimental results on several volumetric datasets.},

The lack of a feedback mechanism to quantify the loss of information in the rendering process makes the design of good transfer functions a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we present the notion of visibility-driven transfer functions, which are transfer functions that provide a good visibility of features of interest from a given viewpoint. To achieve this, we introduce visibility histograms. These histograms provide graphical cues that intuitively inform the user about the contribution of particular scalar values to the final image. By carefully manipulating the parameters of the opacity transfer function, users can now maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest in a volume data set. Based on this observation, we also propose a semi-automated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively improves a transfer function defined by the user, according to a certain importance metric. Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully automatic scheme to visualize multimodal data. To define the fused color, we set an information channel between two registered input datasets, and afterward, we compute the informativeness associated with the respective intensity bins. This informativeness is used to weight the color contribution from both initial 1-D transfer functions. To obtain the opacity, we apply an optimization process that minimizes the informational divergence between the visibility distribution captured by a set of viewpoints and a target distribution proposed by the user. This distribution is defined either from the dataset features, from manually set importances, or from both. Other problems related to the multimodal visualization, such as the computation of the fused gradient and the histogram binning, have also been solved using new information-theoretic strategies. The quality and performance of our approach are evaluated on different datasets.},

	abstract = {In a visualization of a three-dimensional dataset, the insights gained are dependent on what is occluded and what is not. Suggestion of interesting viewpoints can improve both the speed and efficiency of data understanding. This paper presents a view selection method designed for volume rendering. It can be used to find informative views for a given scene, or to find a minimal set of representative views which capture the entire scene. It becomes particularly useful when the visualization process is non-interactive - for example, when visualizing large datasets or time-varying sequences. We introduce a viewpoint "goodness" measure based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the transfer function, the data distribution and the visibility of the voxels. Combined with viewpoint properties like view-likelihood and view-stability, this technique can be used as a guide, which suggests "interesting" viewpoints for further exploration. Domain knowledge is incorporated into the algorithm via an importance transfer function or volume. This allows users to obtain view selection behaviors tailored to their specific situations. We generate a view space partitioning, and select one representative view for each partition. Together, this set of views encapsulates the "interesting" and distinct views of the data. Viewpoints in this set can be used as starting points for interactive exploration of the data, thus reducing the human effort in visualization. In non-interactive situations, such a set can be used as a representative visualization of the dataset from all directions.},

A key issue of generating a good animation is to select ideal views through which the user can perceive the maximum amount of information from the time-varying dataset. In this paper, we first propose an improved view selection method for static data. The method measures the quality of a static view by analyzing the opacity, color and curvature distributions of the corresponding volume rendering images from the given view. Our view selection metric prefers an even opacity distribution with a larger projection area, a larger area of salient features' colors with an even distribution among the salient features, and more perceived curvatures. We use this static view selection method and a dynamic programming approach to select time-varying views. The time-varying view selection maximizes the information perceived from the time-varying dataset based on the constraints that the time-varying view should show smooth changes of direction and near-constant speed. We also introduce a method that allows the user to generate a smooth transition between any two views in a given time step, with the perceived information maximized as well. By combining the static and dynamic view selection methods, the users are able to generate a time-varying view that shows the maximum amount of information from a time-varying data set},

	abstract = {Optimal viewpoint selection is an important task because it considerably influences the amount of information contained in the {2D} projected images of {3D} objects, and thus dominates their first impressions from a psychological point of view. Although several methods have been proposed that calculate the optimal positions of viewpoints especially for {3D} surface meshes, none has been done for solid objects such as volumes. This paper presents a new method of locating such optimal viewpoints when visualizing volumes using direct volume rendering. The major idea behind our method is to decompose an entire volume into a set of feature components, and then find a globally optimal viewpoint by finding a compromise between locally optimal viewpoints for the components. As the feature components, the method employs interval volumes and their combinations that characterize the topological transitions of isosurfaces according to the scalar field. Furthermore, opacity transfer functions are also utilized to assign different weights to the decomposed components so that users can emphasize features of specific interest in the volumes. Several examples of volume datasets together with their optimal positions of viewpoints are exhibited in order to demonstrate that the method can effectively guide naive users to find optimal projections of volumes.},

Image gradients are good for expressing object shapes, but difficult to express the flow or movements of objects. In real painting, the use of brush strokes corresponding to the actual movement of objects allows viewers to recognize objects' motion better and thus to have an impression of the dynamic. In this paper, we propose a novel painterly rendering algorithm to express dynamic objects based on their motion information. We first extract motion information (magnitude, direction, standard deviation) of a scene from a set of consecutive image sequences from the same view. Then the motion directions are used for determining stroke orientations in the regions with significant motions, and image gradients determine stroke orientations where little motion is observed. Our algorithm is useful for realistically and dynamically representing moving objects. We have applied our algorithm for rendering landscapes. We could segment a scene into dynamic and static regions, and express the actual movement of dynamic objects using motion based strokes.},

Painterly animations are generated using a mesh of brush stroke objects with dynamic spatio-temporal properties. Styles govern the behavior of these brush strokes as well as their rendering to a virtual canvas. We present methods for modifying the properties of these brush strokes according to the input images, videos, or motions.

Datasets of this type have grown rapidly in recent years, both in number and in size. Images of the data stored in these collections must support rapid and accurate exploration and analysis. This article presents a method for constructing visualizations that are both effective and aesthetic. Our approach uses techniques from master paintings and human perception to visualize a multidimensional dataset. Individual data elements are drawn with one or more brush strokes that vary their appearance to represent the element's attribute values. The result is a nonphotorealistic visualization of information stored in the dataset. Our research extends existing glyph-based and nonphotorealistic techniques by applying perceptual guidelines to build an effective representation of the underlying data. The nonphotorealistic properties the strokes employ are selected from studies of the history and theory of Impressionist art. We show that these properties are similar to visual features that are detected by the low-level human visual system. This correspondence allows us to manage the strokes to produce perceptually salient visualizations. Psychophysical experiments confirm a strong relationship between the expressive power of our nonphotorealistic properties and previous findings on the use of perceptual color and texture patterns for data display. Results from these studies are used to produce effective nonphotorealistic visualizations. We conclude by applying our techniques to a large, multidimensional weather dataset to demonstrate their viability in a practical, real-world setting.},

	abstract = {Transfer functions are an essential part of volume visualization. In multimodal visualization at least two values exist at every sample point. Additionally, other parameters, such as gradient magnitude, are often retrieved for each sample point. To find a good transfer function for this high number of parameters is challenging because of the complexity of this task. In this paper we present a general information-based approach for transfer function design in multimodal visualization which is independent of the used modality types. Based on information theory, the complex multi-dimensional transfer function space is fused to allow utilization of a well-known {2D} transfer function with a single value and gradient magnitude as parameters. Additionally, a quantity is introduced which enables better separation of regions with complementary information. The benefit of the new method in contrast to other techniques is a transfer function space which is easy to understand and which provides a better separation of different tissues. The usability of the new approach is shown on examples of different modalities.},

Our study provides compelling evidence that information theory can explain a significant number of phenomena or events in visualization, while no example has been found which is fundamentally in conflict with information theory. We also notice that the emphasis of some traditional applications of information theory, such as data compression or data communication, may not always suit visualization, as the former typically focuses on the efficient throughput of a communication channel, whilst the latter focuses on the effectiveness in aiding the perceptual and cognitive process for data understanding and knowledge discovery.

We present an automatic yet powerful method for the automatic setup of multi-dimensional transfer functions by adding spatial information to the histogram of a volume. Using this information we can easily classify the histogram and derive a transfer function by assigning unique colors to each class of the histogram. Each feature can be selected interactively by pointing and clicking at the corresponding class in the transfer function. In order to render the classified volume with adequate quality we propose an extension of the wellknown pre-integration technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by giving examples for the imaging of segmented, diffusion-tensor and multi-modal data.},

We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are {3D} fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel.

	abstract = {Visualization of volumetric data faces the difficult task of finding effective parameters for the transfer functions. Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures. We demonstrate our texture-based transfer function for direct volume rendering with synthetic and real-world medical data to show the strength of our technique.},

Application areas in computer graphics include viewpoint selection, mesh saliency, scene exploration, ambient occlusion, geometry simplification, radiosity, adaptive ray-tracing and shape descriptors. Application areas in visualization are view selection for volume data, flow visualization, ambient occlusion, time-varying volume visualization, transfer function definition, time-varying volume visualization, iso-surface similarity maps and quality metrics. The applications fall broadly into two categories: the mapping of the problem to an information channel - as in viewpoint applications - and the direct use of measures such as entropy, Kullback-Leibler distance, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and f-divergences. These would be used to evaluate, for instance, the homogeneity of a set of samples being used as metrics. We will also discuss the potential applications of the information bottleneck method that allows us to progressively extract or merge information in a hierarchical structure.},

Examples of boundary completion (illusory contours) and featural completion (color, brightness, motion, texture, and depth) are examined, and single-cell studies relevant to filling-in are reviewed and assessed. Filling-in issues must be understood in relation to theoretical issues about neural-perceptual isomorphism and linking propositions. Six main conclusions are drawn: (1) visual filling-in comprises a multitude of different perceptual completion phenomena; (2) certain forms of visual completion seem to involve spatially propagating neural activity (neural filling-in) and so, contrary to Dennett's (1991; 1992) recent discussion of filling-in, cannot be described as results of the brain's "ignoring an absence" or "jumping to a conclusion"; (3) in certain cases perceptual completion seems to have measurable effects that depend on neural signals representing a presence rather than ignoring an absence; (4) neural filling-in does not imply either "analytic isomorphism" or "Cartesian materialism," and thus the notion of the bridge locus--a particular neural stage that forms the immediate substrate of perceptual experience--is problematic and should be abandoned; (5) to reject the representational conception of vision in favor of an "enactive" or "animate" conception reduces the importance of filling-in as a theoretical category in the explanation of vision; and (6) the evaluation of perceptual content should not be determined by "subpersonal" considerations about internal processing, but rather by considerations about the task of vision at the level of the animal or person interacting with the world.},

An analytical scale-invariant description relating the data value to derivatives around Gaussian blurred step edges - arch model - is applied to uniquely combine robustness to noise, global signal fluctuations, anisotropic scale, noncubic voxels, and ease of use via a straightforward segmentation of 3-D {CT} images through material fractions. Projection of noisy data value and derivatives onto the arch yields a robust alternative to the standard computed Gaussian derivatives. This results in a superior precision of the method. The arch-model parameters are derived from a small, but over-determined, set of measurements (data values and derivatives) along a path following the gradient uphill and downhill starting at an edge voxel. The model is first used to identify the expected values of the two pure materials (named and ) and thereby classify the boundary. Second, the model is used to approximate the underlying noise-free material fractions for each noisy measurement. An iso-surface of constant material fraction accurately delineates the material boundary in the presence of noise and global signal fluctuations. This approach enables straightforward segmentation of 3-D {CT} images into objects of interest for computer-aided diagnosis and offers an easy tool for the design of otherwise complicated transfer functions in high-quality visualizations. The method is applied to segment a tooth volume for visualization and digital cleansing for virtual colonoscopy.},

Our approach enables flexible data-driven illumination which goes beyond using the transfer function to just assign colors and opacities. An image-based lighting model uses sphere maps to represent non-photorealistic rendering styles. Style transfer functions allow us to combine a multitude of different shading styles in a single rendering.

	abstract = {Photographic volumes present a unique, interesting challenge for volume rendering. In photographic volumes, the voxel color is pre-determined, making color selection through transfer functions unnecessary. However, photographic data does not contain a clear mapping from the multi-valued color values to a scalar density or opacity, making projection and compositing much more difficult than with traditional volumes. Moreover, because of the nonlinear nature of color spaces, there is no meaningful norm for the multi-valued voxels. Thus, the individual color channels of photographic data must be treated as incomparable data tuples rather than as vector values. Traditional differential geometric tools, such as intensity gradients, density and Laplacians, are distorted by the nonlinear non-orthonormal color spaces that are the domain of the voxel values. We have developed different techniques for managing these issues while directly rendering volumes from photographic data. We present and justify the normalization of color values by mapping {RGB} values to the {CIE} L*u*v* color space. We explore and compare different opacity transfer functions that map three-channel color values to opacity. We apply these many-to-one mappings to the original {RGB} values as well as to the voxels after conversion to L*u*v* space. Direct rendering using transfer functions allows us to explore photographic volumes without having to commit to an a-priori segmentation that might mask fine variations of interest. We empirically compare the combined effects of each of the two color spaces with our opacity transfer functions using source data from the Visible Human project},

Different structures within the data set are rendered locally on an object-by-object basis by either direct volume rendering ({DVR)}, maximum-intensity projection ({MIP)}, surface rendering, value integration (X-ray-like images) or non-photorealistic rendering ({NPR).} All the results of subsequent object renderings are combined globally in a merging step (usually compositing in our case). This allows us to selectively choose the most suitable technique for depicting each object within the data while keeping the amount of information contained in the image at a reasonable level. This is especially useful when inner structures should be visualized together with semi-transparent outer parts, similar to the focus+context approach known from information visualization. We also present an implementation of our approach which allows us to explore volumetric data using two-level rendering at interactive frame rates},

Enhancements to traditional volume renderings are provided through a two-level volume rendering strategy which employs fast {GPU-based} direct volume rendering ({DVR)} coupled with an additional layer of perceptual cues derived from various techniques from the non-photorealistic rendering ({NPR)} literature. The two-level approach allows us to successfully separate the most relevant data from peripheral extraneous detail enabling the user to more effectively understand the visual information. Peripheral details are abstracted but sufficiently retained in order to provide spatial reference. We perform a number of perceptual user experiments which test how this approach affects a user's attention and ability to determine the shape of an object. Results indicate that our approach can provide a significant improvement in user perception of shape in complex visualisations, especially when a user has little or no prior knowledge of the data. Our approach would prove extremely useful in technical, medical or scientific visualisations to improve understanding of detailed volumetric datasets.},

In this paper we present a texture-based hardware-independent technique for time-varying volume flow visualization. It is based on our Accelerated Unsteady Flow {LIC} ({AUFLIC)} algorithm (Liu and Moorhead, 2005), which uses a flow-driven seeding strategy and a dynamic seeding controller to reuse pathlines in the value scattering process to achieve fast time-dependent flow visualization with high temporal-spatial coherence. We extend {AUFLIC} to {3D} scenarios for accelerated generation of volume flow textures. To address occlusion, lack of depth cuing, and poor perception of flow directions within a dense volume, we employ magnitude-based transfer functions and cutting planes in volume rendering to clearly show the flow structure and the flow evolution.},

Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, we aim to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the {IEEE} Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90\% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the {IEEE} Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the {IEEE} Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in {IEEE} Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.},

However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of visualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is broadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of a visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained, how much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that "saving time" in accomplishing a user's task is the most fundamental objective. By giving emphasis to saving time, we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate unnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and stimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as empirical studies, design optimisation and theories of visualization.},

	abstract = {Presents results from a user study that compared six visualization methods for {2D} vector data. Two methods used different distributions of short arrows, two used different distributions of integral curves, one used wedges located to suggest flow lines, and the final one was line-integral convolution ({LIC).} We defined three simple but representative tasks for users to perform using visualizations from each method: (1) locating all critical points in an image, (2) identifying critical point types, and (3) advecting a particle. The results show different strengths and weaknesses for each method. We found that users performed better with methods that: (1) showed the sign of vectors within the vector field, (2) visually represented integral curves, and (3) visually represented the locations of critical points. These results provide quantitative support for some of the anecdotal evidence concerning visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also provide a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods and for defining additional tasks to further understand tradeoffs among methods. They may also be useful for evaluating {2D} vectors on {2D} surfaces embedded in {3D} and for defining analogous tasks for {3D} visualization methods.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial graph cut algorithms have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in vision and graphics. This paper focusses on possibly the simplest application of graph-cuts: segmentation of objects in image data. Despite its simplicity, this application epitomizes the best features of combinatorial graph cuts methods in vision: global optima, practical efficiency, numerical robustness, ability to fuse a wide range of visual cues and constraints, unrestricted topological properties of segments, and applicability to N-D problems. Graph cuts based approaches to object extraction have also been shown to have interesting connections with earlier segmentation methods such as snakes, geodesic active contours, and level-sets. The segmentation energies optimized by graph cuts combine boundary regularization with region-based properties in the same fashion as Mumford-Shah style functionals. We present motivation and detailed technical description of the basic combinatorial optimization framework for image segmentation via s/t graph cuts. After the general concept of using binary graph cut algorithms for object segmentation was first proposed and tested in Boykov and Jolly (2001), this idea was widely studied in computer vision and graphics communities. We provide links to a large number of known extensions based on iterative parameter re-estimation and learning, multi-scale or hierarchical approaches, narrow bands, and other techniques for demanding photo, video, and medical applications.},

In addition, the resulting imagery is often more comprehensible than standard rendering styles, since it focuses attention on important features in the data. We test our algorithms on datasets up to 5123, demonstrating interactive extraction and rendering of line drawings in a variety of drawing styles.},

The representations are inspired by the brush strokes artists apply in layers to create an oil painting. We display commonly visualized quantities such as velocity and vorticity together with three additional mathematically derived quantities: the rate of strain tensor (defined in section 4), and the turbulent charge and turbulent current (defined in section 5). We describe the motivation for simultaneously examining these quantities and use the motivation to guide our choice of visual representation for each particular quantity.

Users frequently want to direct the viewer’s attention to a particular region of their volumes. With many volume rendering tools, this means setting up complex transfer functions to highlight the region of interest, with the unfortunate side effect of potentially affecting the larger image. ClearView allows the user to focus their visualization efforts on the area of their choice, while separating parameters for visualizing of surrounding data. This provides not only a simplified user interface, but finergrained control over the final publication-quality visualization.

Results are validated in terms of region of interest mean values and coefficients of variation for 65 million coincidences including scattered events. Although some discrepancy is observed, agreement between the two different simulation methods is good given the statistical noise in the data. In particular, the percentage difference of the mean values is 3.1\% for tissue, 17\% for the lungs and 18\% for a small lesion. The utility of the procedure is demonstrated by simulating realistic {PET-MR} datasets from multiple volunteers with different breathing patterns.

Automation of transfer function specifications still remains a challenge in volume rendering. This paper presents an approach for automating transfer function generations by utilizing topological attributes derived from the contour tree of a volume. The contour tree acts as a visual index to volume segments, and captures associated topological attributes involved in volumetric data. A residue flow model based on Darcy's Law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them. The proposed approach allows efficient automation of transfer function generations, and exploration on the data to be carried out based on controlling of opacity residue flow rate instead of complex low-level transfer function parameter adjustments. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the practical use of our approach in transfer function generations.},

Nevertheless, long data transfer times and {GPU} memory size limitations are often the main limiting factors, especially for massive, time-varying or multi-volume visualization, as well as for networked visualization on the emerging mobile devices. To address this issue, a variety of level-of-detail data representations and compression techniques have been introduced. In order to improve capabilities and performance over the entire storage, distribution and rendering pipeline, the encoding/decoding process is typically highly asymmetric, and systems should ideally compress at data production time and decompress on demand at rendering time. Compression and level-of-detail pre-computation does not have to adhere to real-time constraints and can be performed off-line for high quality results. In contrast, adaptive real-time rendering from compressed representations requires fast, transient, and spatially independent decompression.

In this work, we propose a modification to the attribute space visualization in which the user is no longer presented with the magnitude of the attribute; instead, the user is presented with an information metric detailing the relationship between attributes of the multivariate volumetric data. In this way, the user can guide their exploration based on the relationship between the attribute magnitude and user selected attribute information as opposed to being constrained by only visualizing the magnitude of the attribute. We refer to this modification to the traditional histogram widget as an abstract attribute space representation. Our system utilizes common one and two-dimensional histogram widgets where the bins of the abstract attribute space now correspond to an attribute relationship in terms of the mean, standard deviation, entropy, or skewness. In this manner, we exploit the relationships and correlations present in the underlying data with respect to the dimension(s) under examination. These relationships are often times key to insight and allow us to guide attribute discovery as opposed to automatic extraction schemes which try to calculate and extract distinct attributes a priori. In this way, our system aids in the knowledge discovery of the interaction of properties within volumetric data.},

	abstract = {Using classical volume visualization, typically a couple of isosurface layers are rendered semi-transparently to show the internal structures contained in the data. However, the opacity transfer function is often difficult to specify such that all the isosurfaces are of high contrast and sufficiently perceivable. In this paper, we propose a volumerendering technique which ensures that the different layers contribute to fairly different regions of the image space. Since the overlapping between the effected regions is reduced, an outer translucent isosurface does not decrease significantly the contrast of a partially hidden inner isosurface. Therefore, the layers of the data become visually well separated. Traditional transfer functions assign color and opacity values to the voxels depending on the density and the gradient. In contrast, we assign also different illumination directions to different materials, and modulate the opacities view-dependently based on the surface normals and the directions of the light sources, which are fixed to the viewing angle. We will demonstrate that this model allows an expressive visualization of volumetric data.},

Highly transparent transfer functions produce cluttered images with many overlapping structures, while clipping techniques completely remove possibly important context information. In this paper, we present a new model for volume rendering, inspired by techniques from illustration. It provides a means of interactively inspecting the interior of a volumetric data set in a feature-driven way which retains context information. The context-preserving volume rendering model uses a function of shading intensity, gradient magnitude, distance to the eye point, and previously accumulated opacity to selectively reduce the opacity in less important data regions. It is controlled by two user-specified parameters. This new method represents an alternative to conventional clipping techniques, sharing their easy and intuitive user control, but does not suffer from the drawback of missing context information.},

The proposed methodology combines an implicit formulation of curvature with convolution-based reconstruction of the field. We give concrete guidelines for implementing the methodology, and illustrate the importance of choosing accurate filters for computing derivatives with convolution. Curvature-based transfer functions are shown to extend the expressivity and utility of volume rendering through contributions in three different application areas: non-photorealistic volume rendering, surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion, and visualization of isosurface uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Volumetric depth peeling  ({VDP)} is an extension to volume rendering that enables display of otherwise occluded features in volume data sets.  {VDP} decouples occlusion calculation from the volume rendering transfer function, enabling independent optimization of settings for rendering and occlusion.  The algorithm is flexible enough to handle multiple regions occluding the object of interest, as well as object self-occlusion, and requires no pre-segmentation of the data set.  {VDP} was developed as an improvement for virtual arthroscopy for the diagnosis of shoulder-joint trauma, and has been generalized for use in other simple and complex joints, and to enable non-invasive urology studies.  In virtual arthroscopy, the surfaces in the joints often occlude each other, allowing limited viewpoints from which to evaluate these surfaces.  In urology studies, the physician would like to position the virtual camera outside the kidney collecting system and see inside it.  By rendering invisible all voxels between the observer's point of view and objects of interest, {VDP} enables viewing from unconstrained positions.  In essence, {VDP} can be viewed as a technique for automatically defining an optimal data- and task-dependent clipping surface.  Radiologists using {VDP} display have been able to perform evaluations of pathologies more easily and more rapidly than with clinical arthroscopy, standard volume rendering, or standard {MRI/CT} slice viewing.},

A set of specification tools is provided for each domain, enabling users with different levels of experience or demanding time restrictions to choose an appropriate approach for their needs. Real-time feedback during the manipulation of parameters has been proven to be crucial to the specification.

In his papers [13], Cormack, then a Professor at Tufts University, in Massachusetts, dev- oped certain mathematical algorithms that, he envisioned, could be used to create an image from X-ray data. Working completely independently of Cormack and at about the same time, Houns eld, a research scientist at {EMI} Central Research Laboratories in the United Kingdom, designed the rst operational {CT} scanner as well as the rst commercially available model. (See [22] and [23]. ) Since 1980, the number of {CT} scans performed each year in the United States has risen from about 3 million to over 67 million. What few people who have had {CT} scans probably realize is that the fundamental problem behind this procedure is essentially mathematical: If we know the values of the integral of a two- or three-dimensional fu- tion along all possible cross-sections, then how can we reconstruct the function itself? This particular example of what is known as an inverse problem was studied by Johann Radon, an Austrian mathematician, in the early part of the twentieth century.},

The principle idea is to consider a time-varying data set as a {3D} array where each voxel contains a time-activity curve ({TAC).} We define and appraise three different {TAC} similarity measures. Based on these measures we introduce three methods to analyze and visualize time-varying data. The first method relates the whole data set to one template {TAC} and creates a {1D} histogram. The second method extends the {1D} histogram into a {2D} histogram by taking the Euclidean distance between voxels into account. The third method does not rely on a template {TAC} but rather creates a {2D} scatter-plot of all {TAC} data points via multi-dimensional scaling. These methods allow the user to specify transfer functions on the {1D} and {2D} histograms and on the scatter plot, respectively. We validate these methods on synthetic dynamic {SPECT} and {PET} data sets and a dynamic planar Gamma camera image of a patient. These techniques are designed to offer researchers and health care professionals a new tool to study the time-varying medical imaging data sets.},

This is accomplished by extending the concept of local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to discretized (multi-)fields. Thus, informative parts of the data can be highlighted in an application-independent, purely mathematical sense. The new measure can be applied to unsteady multifields on regular grids in any application domain.

From this point of view, we can evaluate the effectiveness of visualization by measuring how much information in the original data is being communicated through the visual communication channel. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic framework for flow visualization with a special focus on streamline generation. In our framework, a vector field is modeled as a distribution of directions from which Shannon's entropy is used to measure the information content in the field. The effectiveness of the streamlines displayed in visualization can be measured by first constructing a new distribution of vectors derived from the existing streamlines, and then comparing this distribution with that of the original data set using the conditional entropy. The conditional entropy between these two distributions indicates how much information in the original data remains hidden after the selected streamlines are displayed. The quality of the visualization can be improved by progressively introducing new streamlines until the conditional entropy converges to a small value. We describe the key components of our framework with detailed analysis, and show that the framework can effectively visualize 2D and 3D flow data.},

	abstract = {An important challenge in the application of direct volume rendering to time-varying data is the specification of transfer functions for all time steps. Very little research has been devoted to this problem, however. To address this issue we propose an approach which allows simultaneous classification of the entire time series. We explore options for transfer function specification that are based, either directly or indirectly, on the time histogram. Furthermore, we consider how to effectively provide feedback for interactive classification by exploring options for simultaneous rendering of the time series, again based on the time histogram. Finally, we apply this approach to several large time-varying data sets where we show that the important features at all times are captured with about the same effort it takes to classify one time step using conventional classification.},

By combining several volumes together with different operators into one visualized volume, the user is able to compare values from different data sets in space over time, run, or field without having to mentally switch between different renderings of individual data sets. In this paper, we propose using a volume shader where the user is given the ability to easily select and operate on many data volumes to create comparison relationships. The user specifies an expression with set and numerical operations and her data to see relationships between data fields. Furthermore, we render the contextual information of the volume shader by converting it to a volume tree. We visualize the different levels and nodes of the volume tree so that the user can see the results of suboperations. This gives the user a deeper understanding of the final visualization, by seeing how the parts of the whole are operationally constructed},

They are integrated seamlessly to provide flexible feature classification without context switching between different data presentations during the user interaction. The proposed interface enables users to identify relevant correlation clusters and assign optical properties with lassos, magic wand, and other tools. Furthermore, direct sketching on the volume rendered images has been implemented to probe and edit features. With our system, users can interactively analyze multivariate volumetric data sets by navigating and exploring feature spaces in unified PCP and MDS plots. To further support large-scale multivariate volume data visualization and analysis, Scalable Pivot MDS (SPMDS), parallel adaptive continuous PCP rendering, as well as parallel rendering techniques are developed and integrated into our visualization system. Our experiments show that the system is effective in multivariate volume data visualization and its performance is highly scalable for data sets with different sizes and number of variates.},

	abstract = {We propose a multivariate volume visualization framework that tightly couples dynamic projections with a high-dimensional transfer function design for interactive volume visualization. We assume that the complex, high-dimensional data in the attribute space can be well-represented through a collection of low-dimensional linear subspaces, and embed the data points in a variety of 2D views created as projections onto these subspaces. Through dynamic projections, we present animated transitions between different views to help the user navigate and explore the attribute space for effective transfer function design. Our framework not only provides a more intuitive understanding of the attribute space but also allows the design of the transfer function under multiple dynamic views, which is more flexible than being restricted to a single static view of the data. For large volumetric datasets, we maintain interactivity during the transfer function design via intelligent sampling and scalable clustering. Using examples in combustion and climate simulations, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to visualize interesting structures in the volumetric space.},

	abstract = {Different imaging modalities give insight to vascular, anatomical and functional information which assist diagnosis and therapy planning in medicine. Registration and consecutive visualization allow to combine the image data and thereby convey more meaningful images to the clinician. Applying a voxel based approach based on mutual information, accurate and retrospective registration is provided. However, optimization and consecutive visualization procedures require a huge amount of trilinear interpolation operations to re-sample the data. Ensuring fast performance which is fundamental for medical routine, we suggest an integrated approach which takes advantage of the imaging and texture mapping subsystem of graphics computers. All trilinear interpolation is completely performed with hardware assisted 3D texture mapping. The 1D and 2D histograms of the datasets which are necessary for the calculation of mutual information are obtained with different hardware accelerated imaging operations. For the simultaneous and interactive visualization of the registered datasets a new approach was developed which allows for versatile fusion operations. Using similar procedures supported by hardware, contributes considerably to accelerate registration and visualization. Implementing our approach within a previously presented framework (Hastreiter et al., 1996) (Sommer et al., 1998) based on OpenInventor and OpenGL provides intuitive manipulation. Clinical examples show the value of our approach in practice},

The method proposed here exploits physics unique to smoke in order to design a numerical method that is both fast and efficient on the relatively coarse grids traditionally used in computer graphics applications (as compared to the much finer grids used in the computational fluid dynamics literature). We use the inviscid Euler equations in our model, since they are usually more appropriate for gas modeling and less computationally intensive than the viscous Navier-Stokes equations used by others. In addition, we introduce a physically consistent vorticity confinement term to model the small scale rolling features characteristic of smoke that are absent on most coarse grid simulations. Our model also correctly handles the inter-action of smoke with moving objects.},

They have been integrated within XmdvTool, a public-domain multiresolution visualization system for multivariate data analysis that supports sampling as well as clustering to simplify data. Several interactive operations are provided, including adjusting the data abstraction level, changing selected regions, and setting the acceptable data abstraction quality level. Conducting these operations, analysts can select an optimal data abstraction level. Also, analysts can compare different abstraction methods using the measures to see how well relative data density and outliers are maintained, and then select an abstraction method that meets the requirement of their analytic tasks},

Hence, the distribution of salience over a visualization image is an essential measure of the quality of the visualization. We describe a method for computing such a metric for a visualization image in the context of a given dataset. We show how this technique can be used to analyze a visualization's salience, improve an existing visualization, and choose the best representation from a set of alternatives. The usefulness of this proposed metric is illustrated using examples from information visualization, volume visualization and flow visualization.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development in graphics hardware and volume rendering techniques, many volumetric datasets can now be rendered in real time on a standard PC equipped with a commodity graphics board. However, the effectiveness of the results, especially direct volume rendered images, is difficult to validate and users may not be aware of ambiguous or even misleading information in the results. This limits the applications of volume visualization. In this paper, we introduce four quantitative effectiveness measures: distinguishability, contour clarity, edge consistency, and depth coherence measures, which target different effectiveness issues for direct volume rendered images. Based on the measures, we develop a visualization system with automatic effectiveness assessment, providing users with instant feedback on the effectiveness of the results. The case study and user evaluation have demonstrated the high potential of our system.},

To overcome this problem, we present a system for automatic transfer function design based on visibility distribution and projective color mapping. Instead of assigning opacity directly based on voxel intensity and gradient magnitude, the opacity transfer function is automatically derived by matching the observed visibility distribution to a target visibility distribution. An automatic color assignment scheme based on projective mapping is proposed to assign colors that allow for the visual discrimination of different structures, while also reflecting the degree of similarity between them. When our method was tested on several medical volumetric datasets, the key structures within the volume were clearly visualized with minimal user intervention.},

Additional complications may result from possible parameter co-dependencies. Here, we will introduce an efficient user study design and analysis strategy that is geared to cope with this problem. The user feedback is fast and easy to obtain and does not require exhaustive parameter testing. To enable such a framework we have modified a preference measuring methodology, conjoint analysis, that originated in psychology and is now also widely used in market research. We demonstrate our framework by a study that measures the perceived quality in volume rendering within the context of large parameter spaces.},

Our technique is a generalization of cut-away views, which Â¿ depending on the viewpoint Â¿ remove or suppress less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. We automatize and apply this idea to volumetric data. Each part of the volumetric data is assigned an object importance which encodes visibility priority. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image. This paper also discusses several possible schemes for level of sparseness specification and different ways how object importance can be composited to determine the final appearance of a particular object.},

In this paper we introduce the idea of mesh saliency as a measure of regional importance for graphics meshes. Our notion of saliency is inspired by low-level human visual system cues. We define mesh saliency in a scale-dependent manner using a center-surround operator on Gaussian-weighted mean curvatures. We observe that such a definition of mesh saliency is able to capture what most would classify as visually interesting regions on a mesh. The human-perception-inspired importance measure computed by our mesh saliency operator results in more visually pleasing results in processing and viewing of 3D meshes. compared to using a purely geometric measure of shape. such as curvature. We discuss how mesh saliency can be incorporated in graphics applications such as mesh simplification and viewpoint selection and present examples that show visually appealing results from using mesh saliency.},

Furthermore, the possibility of automatically calculating transfer functions which generate a particular visibility histogram when applied to a dataset from a particular viewing direction is explored.

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

	abstract = {Multi-modality (MM) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) visualises biological and physiological functions (from PET) as region of interests (ROIs) within a higher resolution anatomical reference frame (from CT). The need to efficiently assess and assimilate the information from these co-aligned volumes simultaneously has stimulated new visualisation techniques that combine 3D volume rendering with interactive transfer functions to enable efficient manipulation of these volumes. However, in typical MM volume rendering visualisation, the transfer functions for the volumes are manipulated in isolation with the resulting volumes being fused, thus failing to exploit the spatial correlation that exists between the aligned volumes. Such lack of feedback makes MM transfer function manipulation complex and time consuming. Further, transfer function alone is often insufficient to select the ROIs when they have similar voxel properties to those of non-relevant regions. In this study, we propose a new ROI-based MM visibility-driven transfer function (m 2-vtf) for PET-CT visualisation. We present a novel ‘visibility’ metric, a fundamental optical property that represents how much of the ROIs are visible to the users, and use it to measure the visibility of the ROIs in PET in relation to how it is affected by transfer function manipulations to its counterpart CT. To overcome the difficulty in ROI selection, we provide an intuitive ROI selection tool based on automated PET segmentation. We further present a MM transfer function automation where the visibility metrics from the PET ROIs are used to automate its CT’s transfer function. Our GPU implementation achieved an interactive visualisation of PET-CT with efficient and intuitive transfer function manipulations.},

One of the challenges in multimodal visualization is how to simplify the process of generating informative pictures from complementary data. In this paper we present an automatic technique that makes use of dual modality information, such as CT and PET, to produce effective focus+context volume visualization. With volume ray casting, per-ray visibility histograms summarize the contribution of samples along each ray to the final image. By quantifying visibility for the region of interest, indicated by the PET data, occluding tissues can be made just transparent enough to give a clear view of the features in that region while preserving some context. Unlike most previous methods relying on costly-preprocessing and tedious manual tuning, our technique achieves comparable and better results based on on-the-fly processing that still enables interactive visualization. Our work thus offers a powerful visualization technique for examining multimodal volume data. We demonstrate the technique with scenarios for the detection and diagnosis of cancer and other pathologies.},

Here we address the following questions: What types of saliency attract attention and how do they compare to each other during natural vision? We asked human participants to inspect scene-shuffled video clips, tracked their instantaneous eye-position, and quantified how well a battery of computational saliency models predicted overt attentional selections (saccades). Saliency effects were measured as a function of total viewing time, proximity to abrupt scene transitions (jump cuts), and inter-participant consistency. All saliency models predicted overall attentional selection well above chance, with dynamic models being equally predictive to each other, and up to 3.6 times more predictive than static models. The prediction accuracy of all dynamic models was twice higher than their average for saccades that were initiated immediately after jump cuts, and led to maximal inter-participant consistency. Static models showed mixed results in these circumstances, with some models having weaker prediction accuracy than their average. These results demonstrate that dynamic visual cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention, while static visual cues correlate with attentional selection mostly due to top-down causes.},

The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent. This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is commonly used in clinical routine for diagnosing vascular diseases. The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimization-based method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration.},

In the first phase, for each time step, we use a weighted mapping function which combines linear mapping and feature histogram. In the second phase, an optimization function taking global color mapping and minimum color difference into consideration is designed. So users can clearly distinguish between data in variable time steps and easily understand the corresponding relationships between different structures.

	abstract = {Automatic detection of meaningful isosurfaces is important for producing informative visualizations of volume data, especially when no information about the data origin and imaging protocol is available. We propose a computationally efficient method for the automated detection of intensity transitions in volume data. In this approach, the dominant transitions correspond to clear maxima in cumulative Laplacian-weighted gray value histograms. Only one pass through the data volume is required to compute the histogram. Several other features which may be useful for exploration of data of unknown origin can be efficiently computed in a similar manner. The detected intensity transitions can be used for setting of visualization parameters for surface rendering, as well as for direct volume rendering of 3D datasets. When using surface rendering, the detected dominant intensity transition values correspond to the optimal surface isovalues for extraction of boundaries of the objects of interest. In direct volume rendering, such transitions are important for generation of the transfer functions, which are used to assign visualization properties to data voxels and determine the appearance of the rendered image. The proposed method is illustrated by examples with synthetic data as well as real biomedical datasets.},

	abstract = {Direct volume rendering (DVR) has become a widely used technique for visualizing anatomical structures in medical 3D datasets The aim of this study was to locally adapt the opacity transfer function (OTF) in order to improve the results achieved when rendering 3D echocardiographic datasets using DVR. A novel approach for defining locally adaptive OTFs has been tested and adapted to echo data and implemented on the GPU. The local OTF is modeled as a truncated second order polynomial. The algorithm locates significant transitions along the ray profile (feature detection along the ray) in order to estimate an opacity threshold (below which all values are considered transparent) and the steepness of the polynomial for each ray. A reference global OTF and the locally adaptive algorithm have been implemented on a GPU using OpenCL and tested on a dataset of nine 3D echo recordings. The rendering resolution is 512Ã—512Ã—300, while average timing is 28ms, 104ms for the reference and the new method respectively. The locally adaptive OTFs were able to compensate for high variations in tissue (and such reducing wall drop-outs) and blood pool signal (reducing spurious structures inside the cavity). The method depends on a number of user defined parameters, determining these values robustly is subject of ongoing research.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: On sample datasets (a mathematical phantom and a patient pelvis CT scan), standard viewing orientations were selected to render the prostate. Opacity functions were selected via (1) trapezoidal manual selection, (2) trapezoidal semiautomatic selection, and (3) histogram volume-based selection. Using an established metric, the errors using each of these methods were computed.
RESULTS: Trapezoidal manual opacity function optimization resulted in visually acceptable images, but the errors were considerable (6.3-9.1 voxel units). These errors could be reduced with the use of trapezoidal semiautomatic selection (4.9-6.2 voxel units) or with histogram volume-based selection (4.8-7.9 voxel units). As each visualization algorithm focused on enhancing the boundary of the prostate using a different approach, the scene information was considerably different using the three techniques.
CONCLUSION: Improved volume visualization of soft tissue interfaces was achieved using automated optimal opacity function determination, compared with manual selection.},

We describe an intuitive user interface for specifying the classification functions that consists of the users painting directly on sample slices of the volume.These painted regions are used to automatically define high-dimensional classification functions that can be implemented in hardware for interactive rendering.The classification of the volume is iteratively improved as the user paints samples, allowing intuitive and efficient viewing of materials of interest.},

We introduce an intuitive user interface that allows the user to work in the cluster space, which shows the material classes with a set of material widgets, rather than work in the transfer function space.

This paper presents a new approach to the problem of extracting and visualizing 4D features within large volume data. Conventional methods requires either an analytical description of the feature of interest or tedious manual intervention throughout the feature extraction and tracking process. We show that it is possible for a visualization system to "learn" to extract and track features in complex 4D flow field according to their "visual" properties, location, shape, and size. The basic approach is to employ machine learning in the process of visualization. Such an intelligent system approach is powerful because it allows us to extract and track an feature of interest in a high-dimensional space without explicitly specifying the relations between those dimensions, resulting in a greatly simplified and intuitive visualization interface.},

Typical tasks in analyzing time-series data include identifying cyclic behavior, outliers, trends, and periods of time that share distinctive shape characteristics. Many methods for visualizing time series data exist, generally mapping the data values to positions or colors. While each can be used to perform a subset of the above tasks, none to date is a complete solution. In this paper we present a novel approach to time-series data visualization, namely creating multivariate data records out of short subsequences of the data and then using multivariate visualization methods to display and explore the data in the resulting shape space. We borrow ideas from text analysis, where the use of N-grams is a common approach to decomposing and processing unstructured text. By mapping each temporal N-gram to a glyph, and then positioning the glyphs via PCA (basically a projection in shape space), many different kinds of patterns in the sequence can be readily identified. Interactive selection via brushing, in conjunction with linking to other visualizations, provides a wide range of tools for exploring the data. We validate the usefulness of this approach with examples from several application domains and tasks, comparing our methods with traditional time-series visualizations.},

Previous work proposed functional representation using basis functions as one solution for interactively visualizing scattered data by harnessing the power of modern PC graphics boards. In this paper, we use the functional representation approach for time-varying data sets and develop an efficient encoding technique utilizing temporal similarity between time steps. Our system utilizes a graduated approach of three methods with increasing time complexity based on the lack of similarity of the evolving data sets. Using this system, we are able to enhance the encoding performance for the time-varying data sets, reduce the data storage by saving only changed or additional basis functions over time, and interactively visualize the time-varying encoding results. Moreover, we present efficient rendering of the functional representations using binary space partitioning tree textures to increase the rendering performance.},

In this paper, we present a novel volume visualization technique with the opacity modulation based peeling. A parameter is calculated according to the intensity difference of local maximum and current samples whenever a new maximum is encountered during the ray casting, that is employed to weight the accumulated color and opacity values to highlight the current sampling structure. In order to further display more internal structures, we divide the intensity values along each viewing ray into different segmentations, while the accumulated modulation opacity is approaching to overflow. Inspired by traditional opacity peeling and maximum intensity difference accumulation, the proposed opacity modulation based peeling method cannot only provide the domain experts with different layered images for more internal information, but also display structures of interest occluded by conventional direct volume rendering in each layer. Furthermore, such an effective algorithm can be easily implemented based on volume ray casting with current graphics hardware and do have some application values.},

We redistribute the opacity within a voxel to improve the readability of the color defined by a regular transfer function, and to maintain the see-through capabilities of volume rendering. We use predictable procedural noise - random-phase Gabor noise - to generate a high-frequency redistribution pattern and construct an opacity mapping function, which allows to partition the available space among the displayed data attributes. This mapping function is appropriately filtered to avoid aliasing, while maintaining transparent regions. We show the usefulness of our approach on various data sets and with different example applications. Furthermore, we evaluate our method by comparing it to other visualization techniques in a controlled user study. Overall, the results of our study indicate that users are much more accurate in determining exact data values with our novel 3D volume visualization method. Significantly lower error rates for reading data values and high subjective ranking of our method imply that it has a high chance of being adopted for the purpose of visualization of multivariate 3D data.},

	abstract = {In this dissertation, we show how we can use principles of saliency to enhance depiction, manage visual attention, and increase interactivity for 3D graphics and visualization. Current mesh saliency approaches are inspired by low-level human visual cues, but have not yet been validated. Our eye-tracking-based user study shows that the current computational model of mesh saliency can well approximate human eye movements. Artists, illustrators, photographers, and cinematographers have long used the principles of contrast and composition to guide visual attention. We present a visual-saliency-based operator to draw visual attention to selected regions of interest. We have observed that it is more successful at eliciting viewer attention than the traditional Gaussian enhancement operator for visualizing both volume datasets and 3D meshes.

Mesh saliency can be measured in various ways. The previous model of saliency computes saliency by identifying the uniqueness of curvature. Another way to identify uniqueness is to look for non-repeating structure in the middle of repeating structure. We have developed a system to detect repeating patterns in 3D point datasets. We introduce the idea of creating vertex and transformation streams that represent large point datasets via their interaction. This dramatically improves arithmetic intensity and addresses the input geometry bandwidth bottleneck for interactive 3D graphics applications.

Fast-previewing of time-varing datasets is important for the purpose of summarization and abstraction. We compute the salient frames in molecular dynamics simulations through the subspace analysis of the protein's residue orientations. We first compute an affinity matrix for each frame i of the simulation based on the similarity of the orientation of the protein's backbone residues. Eigenanalysis of the affinity matrix gives us the subspace that best represents the conformation of the current frame i. We use this subspace to represent the frames ahead and behind frame i. The more accurately we can use the subspace of frame i to represent its neighbors, the less salient it is.

Taken together, the tools and techniques developed in this dissertation are likely to provide the building blocks for the next generation visual analysis, reasoning, and discovery environments.},

One of the emerging branches of this research is the texture based transfer functions. Although several studies in two, three, and four dimensional image processing show the importance of using texture information, these studies generally focus on segmentation. However, TFs can also be built effectively using appropriate texture information. To accomplish this, methods should be developed to collect wide variety of shape, orientation, and texture of biological tissues and organs. In this study, volumetric data (i.e., domain of a TF) is enhanced using brushlet expansion, which represents both low and high frequency textured structures at different quadrants in transform domain. Three methods (i.e., expert based manual, atlas and machine learning based automatic) are proposed for selection of the quadrants. Non-linear manipulation of the complex brushlet coefficients is also used prior to the tiling of selected quadrants and reconstruction of the volume. Applications to abdominal data sets acquired with CT, MR, and PET show that the proposed volume enhancement effectively improves the quality of 3D rendering using well-known TF specification techniques.},

	abstract = {The field of volume visualization has undergone rapid development during the past years, both due to advances in suitable computing hardware and due to the increasing availability of large volume datasets. Recent work has focused on increasing the visual realism in Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) by integrating a number of visually plausible but often effect-specific rendering techniques, for instance modeling of light occlusion and depth of field. Besides yielding more attractive renderings, especially the more realistic lighting has a positive effect on perceptual tasks. Although these new rendering techniques yield impressive results, they exhibit limitations in terms of their exibility and their performance. Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), coupled with physically based light transport, is the de-facto standard for synthesizing highly realistic images in the graphics domain, although usually not from volumetric data. Due to the stochastic sampling of MCRT algorithms, numerous effects can be achieved in a relatively straight-forward fashion. For this reason, we have developed a practical framework that applies MCRT techniques also to direct volume rendering (DVR). With this work, we demonstrate that a host of realistic effects, including physically based lighting, can be simulated in a generic and flexible fashion, leading to interactive DVR with improved realism. In the hope that this improved approach to DVR will see more use in practice, we have made available our framework under a permissive open source license.},

	abstract = {Multi-modality positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging depicts biological and physiological functions (from PET) within a higher resolution anatomical reference frame (from CT). The need to efficiently assimilate the information from these co-aligned volumes simultaneously has resulted in 3D visualisation methods that depict e.g., slice of interest (SOI) from PET combined with direct volume rendering (DVR) of CT. However because DVR renders the whole volume, regions of interests (ROIs) such as tumours that are embedded within the volume may be occluded from view. Volume clipping is typically used to remove occluding structures by `cutting away' parts of the volume; this involves tedious trail-and-error tweaking of the clipping attempts until a satisfied visualisation is made, thus restricting its application. Hence, we propose a new automated opacity-driven volume clipping method for PET-CT using DVR-SOI visualisation. Our method dynamically calculates the volume clipping depth by considering the opacity information of the CT voxels in front of the PET SOI, thereby ensuring that only the relevant anatomical information from the CT is visualised while not impairing the visibility of the PET SOI. We outline the improvements of our method when compared to conventional 2D and traditional DVR-SOI visualisations.},

However, the need to access and assimilate the two volumes simultaneously has raised new visualization challenges. In typical dual-modal visualization, the transfer functions for the two volumes are designed in isolation with the resulting volumes being fused. Unfortunately, such transfer function design fails to exploit the correlation that exists between the two volumes. In this study, we propose a dual-modal visualization method where we employ `visibility' metrics to provide interactive visual feedback regarding the occlusion caused by the first volume on the second volume and vice versa. We further introduce a region of interest (ROI) function that allows visibility analyses to be restricted to subsection of the volume. We demonstrate the new visualization enabled by our proposed dual-modal visibility metrics using clinical whole-body PET-CT studies of various diseases.},

One prerequisite and fundamental issue is how to infer three-dimensional information through users’ two-dimensional input. Existing approaches commonly build on the hypothesis that user input is precise, which is sometimes invalid because of multiple causes like data noise, limited resolution of display devices and users’ casual input. In this paper, we reconsider some design choices of previous methods and propose an alternative effective algorithm for inferring interaction position in scientific data, especially volume data exploration. Our method automatically assists user interaction with the defined saliency. The presented saliency integrates data value, corresponding transfer function and user input. The result saliency implies remarkable regions of raw data as existing methods. Moreover, it reflects the areas of users’ concern. Thirdly, it eliminates the errors from data and device, helping users get the region they focus on. Various experiments have verified that our method can reasonably refine user interaction and effectively help users access interested features. Graphical Abstract},

In the following, we present an interactive GPU-based illustrative volume rendering framework, called VolFliesGPU. In this framework, isosurfaces are sampled by evenly distributed particle sets, delineating surface shape by illustrative styles. The appearance of these styles is based on locally-measured surface properties. For instance, hatches convey surface shape by orientation and shape characteristics are enhanced by color, mapped using a curvature-based transfer function. Hidden-surfaces are generally removed to avoid visual clutter, after that a combination of styles is applied per isosurface. Multiple surfaces and styles can be explored interactively, exploiting parallelism in both graphics hardware and particle systems. We achieve real-time interaction and prompt parametrization of the illustrative styles, using an intuitive GPGPU paradigm that delivers the computational power to drive our particle system and visualization algorithms.},

By addressing this problem, we introduce a semi-automatic method for initial generation of TFs. The proposed method uses a self generating hierarchical radial basis function network to determine the lobes of a volume histogram stack (VHS) which is introduced as a new domain by aligning the histograms of slices of a image series. The new self generating hierarchical design strategy allows the recognition of suppressed lobes corresponding to suppressed tissues and representation of the overlapping regions which are parts of the lobes but can not be represented by the Gaussian bases in VHS. Moreover, approximation with a minimum set of basis functions provides the possibility of selecting and adjusting suitable units to optimize the TF.

However, the mapping from data attributes to the optical properties is defined by transfer functions, the design of which is always a challenging and time-consuming task, even for expert users. In order to build informative images from original volume datasets without specifying intricate transfer functions, we present in this paper a depth-based feature enhancement visualization technique that could provide all features along the viewing ray at once, even with a simple linear transfer function. Once the accumulated opacity overflows, our approach resorts to an adaptive depth-based weighting to reduce the accumulated opacity value for adjusting the contribution of each voxel in the final pixel. To improve the visual perception of interesting features, such a modulation would be further enhanced when local maximum structures are encountered along the viewing ray. In addition, we provide a focus and context interaction and achieve a depth-based clipping operation to help users distinguish the order of internal structures. We conduct experiments on several volumetric datasets, and more structural information is presented and features of interest are largely enhanced in our rendering results, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This paper presents a framework for designing new transfer functions that use bionic algorithms to map the frequency of particle occurrences to the color and opacity values. This allows us to extract features from the volume data. In particular, a novel approach is presented to allow a user to design a transfer function using the techniques of swarm intelligence. This approach consists of a population of simple agents interacting locally with one another and with the volume data. The agents scatter around the volume data and approach areas that contain features. Their movements are not only based on solution optimization, but are also governed by global optimization. After the agents have finished searching for features in the volume data, they can automatically modify the transfer function according to agents’ behavior. With these agents, we do not have to preprocess the volume data for visualizing and exploring the features.},

	abstract = {Multi-dimensional transfer functions are widely used to provide appropriate data classification for direct volume rendering. Nevertheless, the design of a multi-dimensional transfer function is a complicated task. In this paper, we propose to use parallel coordinates, a powerful tool to visualize high-dimensional geometry and analyze multivariate data, for multi-dimensional transfer function design. This approach has two major advantages: (1) Combining the information of spatial space (voxel position) and parameter space; (2) Selecting appropriate highdimensional parameters to obtain sophisticated data classification. Although parallel coordinates offers simple interface for the user to design the high-dimensional transfer function, some extra work such as sorting the coordinates is inevitable. Therefore, we use a local linear embedding technique for dimension reduction to reduce the burdensome calculations in the high dimensional parameter space and to represent the transfer function concisely. With the aid of parallel coordinates, we propose some novel high-dimensional transfer function widgets for better visualization results. We demonstrate the capability of our parallel coordinates based transfer function (PCbTF) design method for direct volume rendering using CT and MRI datasets.},

	abstract = {Direct volume rendering techniques have been successfully applied to visualizing volumetric datasets across many application domains. Due to the sensitivity of transfer functions and the complexity of fine-tuning transfer functions, direct volume rendering is still not widely used in practice. For fast volumetric data exploration, we propose Importance-Based Accumulated Transparency Modulation which does not rely on transfer function manipulation. This novel rendering algorithm is a generalization and extension of the Maximum Intensity Difference Accumulation technique. By only modifying the accumulated transparency, the resulted volume renderings are essentially high dynamic range. We show that by using several common importance measures, different features of the volumetric datasets can be highlighted. The results can be easily extended to a high-dimensional importance difference space, by mixing the results from an arbitrary number of importance measures with weighting factors, which all control the final output with a monotonic behavior. With Importance-Based Accumulated Transparency Modulation, the end-user can explore a wide variety of volumetric datasets quickly without the burden of manually setting and adjusting a transfer function.},

Different transparency settings can be flexibly assigned to different structures such that some valuable information can be revealed in direct volume rendered images (DVRIs). However, end-users often feel that some risks are always associated with DVR because they do not know whether any important information is missing from the transparent regions of DVRIs. In this paper, we investigate how to semi-automatically generate a set of DVRIs and also an animation which can reveal information missed in the original DVRIs and meanwhile satisfy some image quality criteria such as coherence. A complete framework is developed to tackle various problems related to the generation and quality evaluation of visibility-aware DVRIs and animations. Our technique can reduce the risk of using direct volume rendering and thus boost the confidence of users in volume rendering systems.},

Transfer function design remains a difficult task since current methods, such as traditional 1D and 2D transfer functions, are not always effective for all data sets. Various 1D or 2D transfer function spaces have been proposed to improve classification exploiting different aspects, such as using the gradient magnitude for boundary location and statistical, occlusion, or size metrics. In this paper, we present a novel transfer function method which can provide more specificity for data classification by combining different transfer function spaces. In this work, a 2D transfer function can be combined with 1D transfer functions which improve the classification. Specifically, we use the traditional 2D scalar/gradient magnitude, 2D statistical, and 2D occlusion spectrum transfer functions and combine these with occlusion and/or size-based transfer functions to provide better specificity. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new method by comparing to the following previous techniques: 2D gradient magnitude, 2D occlusion spectrum, 2D statistical transfer functions and 2D size based transfer functions.},

By deriving transition probabilities among states, we construct a global map that captures the essential transition relationships in the time-varying data. We introduce the TransGraph, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The TransGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking. The user interacts with the TransGraph and makes connection to the volumetric data through brushing and linking. A set of intuitive queries is provided to enable knowledge extraction from time-varying data.

Two experiments with novices and one experiment with experts were performed. The results with novices showed that the pseudo-chromadepth and fog cues were stronger cues than that of stereopsis. Furthermore, the addition of the stereopsis cue to the other cues did not improve relative depth perception in cerebral vascular volumes. In contrast to novices, the experts also performed well with the edge cue. In terms of both novice and expert subjects, pseudo-chromadepth and fog allow for the best relative depth perception.

	abstract = {In many applications of Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) the importance of a certain material or feature is highly dependent on its relative spatial location. For instance, in the medical diagnostic procedure, the patient's symptoms often lead to specification of features, tissues and organs of particular interest. One such example is pockets of gas which, if found inside the body at abnormal locations, are a crucial part of a diagnostic visualization. This paper presents an approach that enhances DVR transfer function design with spatial localization based on user specified material dependencies. Semantic expressions are used to define conditions based on relations between different materials, such as only render iodine uptake when close to liver. The underlying methods rely on estimations of material distributions which are acquired by weighing local neighborhoods of the data against approximations of material likelihood functions. This information is encoded and used to influence rendering according to the user's specifications. The result is improved focus on important features by allowing the user to suppress spatially less-important data. In line with requirements from actual clinical DVR practice, the methods do not require explicit material segmentation that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to achieve in most real cases. The scheme scales well to higher dimensions which accounts for multi-dimensional transfer functions and multivariate data. Dual-Energy Computed Tomography, an important new modality in radiology, is used to demonstrate this scalability. In several examples we show significantly improved focus on clinically important aspects in the rendered images.},

We show how segmented data sets can be rendered interactively on current consumer graphics hardware with high image quality and pixel-resolution filtering of object boundaries. In order to enhance object perception, we employ different levels of object distinction. First, each object can be assigned an individual transfer function, multiple of which can be applied in a single rendering pass. Second, different rendering modes such as direct volume rendering, iso-surfacing, and non-photorealistic techniques can be selected for each object. A minimal number of rendering passes is achieved by processing sets of objects that share the same rendering mode in a single pass. Third, local compositing modes such as alpha blending and MIP can be selected for each object in addition to a single global mode, thus enabling high-quality two-level volume rendering on GPUs.},

This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research.

To evaluate these models, users had to solve three tasks relying on correct depth as well as size perception. Our motivation for these three tasks was to find relations between the used illumination model, user accuracy and the elapsed time. In an additional task, users had to subjectively judge the output of the tested models. After first reviewing the models and their features, we will introduce the individual tasks and discuss their results. We discovered statistically significant differences in the testing performance of the techniques. Based on these findings, we have analyzed the models and extracted those features which are possibly relevant for the improved spatial comprehension in a relational task.

Some of these lenses can be interactively configured by the user to specify the desired magnification patterns, while others are feature-adaptive. All our lenses are accelerated on the GPU. They allow the user to interactively manage the available screen area, dedicating more area to the more resolution-important features.},

	abstract = {Although graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration makes possible interactive volume rendering, successful volume visualization relies on the ability to quickly and correctly classify the volume into different materials or features. Among various classification techniques, one very attractive and effective method is employing machine learning to classify the whole volume according to some minimum user input through an interactive brushing interface, where users paint directly on slices of the volume. For routine visualization tasks, we can thus reduce their cost if the visualization system can learn the tasks and apply the captured knowledge in future tasks. This paper presents an intelligent, interactive visualization system that supports Focus+Context viewing of volume data. Features of interest should be the focal point of the visualization, and by applying appropriate rendering methods we are able to enhance these features and create more illustrative visualizations in a Focus+Context style. We show with a set of case studies that it is possible to use machine learning to not only help classify volume but also better present the classified results. This new capability makes visualization a more usable tool.},

	abstract = {Artistic illustrations of important structures in fluid flow have a long-standing tradition and are appreciated as clearly perceivable, instructive, but still conveying all relevant information to the viewer. One important illustrative technique for such visualizations are cutaways. Currently cutaways are placed manually or using view-vector based approaches. We propose to optimize the visibility of important target features based on a degree-of-interest (DOI) function. The DOI is specified during interactive visual analysis, e.g., by brushing scatterplots. We show that the problem of placing cutaway boxes optimally is NP-hard in the number of boxes. To overcome this obstacle, we present an intelligent method to compute cutaways. Geometric cutaway objects are positioned using a view-dependent objective function which optimizes the visibility of all features. In order to approximate the optimal solution, we use a Monte Carlo method and exploit temporal coherence in dynamic scenes. Performance-critical parts are implemented on the GPU. The proposed method can be integrated easily into existing rendering frameworks and is general enough to be able to optimize other parameters besides cutaways as well. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm and provide a case study of vorticity visualization in a turbulent flow.},

However, it is difficult to provide a fused visualization that allows sufficient spatial perception of the anatomy of interest, as derived from the rich pre-operative scan, while not occluding the real-time image displayed embedded within the volume. We propose an importance-driven approach that presents the embedded data such that it is clearly visible along with its spatial relation to the surrounding volumetric material. To support this, we present and integrate novel techniques for importance specification, feature emphasis, and contextual cutaway generation. We show results in a clinical context where a pre-operative CT scan is visualized alongside a tracked ultrasound image, such that the important vasculature is depicted between the viewpoint and the ultrasound image, while a more opaque representation of the anatomy is exposed in the surrounding area.},

Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions.},

The theory proposes a computational role for attention and leads to a model that predicts some of its main properties at the level of psychophysics and physiology. In our approach, the main goal of the visual system is to infer the identity and the position of objects in visual scenes: spatial attention emerges as a strategy to reduce the uncertainty in shape information while feature-based attention reduces the uncertainty in spatial information. Featural and spatial attention represent two distinct modes of a computational process solving the problem of recognizing and localizing objects, especially in difficult recognition tasks such as in cluttered natural scenes.

We describe a specific computational model and relate it to the known functional anatomy of attention. We show that several well-known attentional phenomena – including bottom-up pop-out effects, multiplicative modulation of neuronal tuning curves and shift in contrast responses – all emerge naturally as predictions of the model. We also show that the Bayesian model predicts well human eye fixations (considered as a proxy for shifts of attention) in natural scenes.},

The algorithm is inspired by biological mechanisms of motion-based perceptual grouping and extends a discriminant formulation of center-surround saliency previously proposed for static imagery. Under this formulation, the saliency of a location is equated to the power of a predefined set of features to discriminate between the visual stimuli in a center and a surround window, centered at that location. The features are spatiotemporal video patches and are modeled as dynamic textures, to achieve a principled joint characterization of the spatial and temporal components of saliency. The combination of discriminant center-surround saliency with the modeling power of dynamic textures yields a robust, versatile, and fully unsupervised spatiotemporal saliency algorithm, applicable to scenes with highly dynamic backgrounds and moving cameras. The related problem of background subtraction is treated as the complement of saliency detection, by classifying nonsalient (with respect to appearance and motion dynamics) points in the visual field as background. The algorithm is tested for background subtraction on challenging sequences, and shown to substantially outperform various state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitatively, its average error rate is almost half that of the closest competitor.},

We first consider the properties of the log-Laplacian spectrum of the mesh. Those frequencies which show differences from expected behaviour capture saliency in the frequency domain. Information about these frequencies is considered in the spatial domain at multiple spatial scales to localise the salient features and give the final salient areas. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach are demonstrated by comparisons to previous approaches on a range of test models. The benefits of the proposed method are further evaluated in applications such as mesh simplification, mesh segmentation, and scan integration, where we show how incorporating mesh saliency can provide improved results.},

The mutual information of this channel is shown to be a powerful tool to deal with viewpoint selection, viewpoint stability, object exploration and viewpoint-based saliency. In addition, viewpoint mutual information is extended using saliency as an importance factor, showing how perceptual criteria can be incorporated to our method. Although we use a sphere of viewpoints around an object, our framework is also valid for any set of viewpoints in a closed scene.

In this paper, we present a novel view-dependent algorithm that can minimize occlusion and reveal important flow features for three dimensional flow fields. To analyze regions of higher importance, we utilize Shannon's entropy as a measure of vector complexity. An entropy field in the form of a three dimensional volume is extracted from the input vector field. To utilize this view-independent complexity measure for view-dependent calculations, we introduce the notion of a maximal entropy projection (MEP) framebuffer, which stores maximal entropy values as well as the corresponding depth values for a given viewpoint. With this information, we develop a view-dependent streamline selection algorithm that can evaluate and choose streamlines that will cause minimum occlusion to regions of higher importance. Based on a similar concept, we also propose a viewpoint selection algorithm that works hand-in-hand with our streamline selection algorithm to maximize the visibility of high complexity regions in the flow field.},

While traditional methods rely on ultimate images for quality measurement, we introduce the LOD map - an alternative representation of LOD quality and a visual interface for navigating multiresolution data exploration. Our measure for LOD quality is based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the distortion and contribution of multiresolution data blocks. A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features. It also allows us to compare different views and perform rendering budget control. A set of interactive techniques is proposed to make the LOD adjustment a simple and easy task. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on large scientific and medical data sets},

	abstract = {Simultaneous visualization of multiple continuous data attributes in a single visualization is a task that is important for many application areas. Unsurprisingly, many methods have been proposed to solve this task. However, the behavior of such methods during the exploration stage, when the user tries to understand the data with panning and zooming, has not been given much attention. In this paper, we propose a method that uses procedural texture synthesis to create zoom-independent visualizations of three scalar data attributes. The method is based on random-phase Gabor noise, whose frequency is adapted for the visualization of the first data attribute. We ensure that the resulting texture frequency lies in the range that is perceived well by the human visual system at any zoom level. To enhance the perception of this attribute, we also apply a specially constructed transfer function that is based on statistical properties of the noise. Additionally, the transfer function is constructed in a way that it does not introduce any aliasing to the texture. We map the second attribute to the texture orientation. The third attribute is color coded and combined with the texture by modifying the value component of the HSV color model. The necessary contrast needed for texture and color perception was determined in a user study. In addition, we conducted a second user study that shows significant advantages of our method over current methods with similar goals. We believe that our method is an important step towards creating methods that not only succeed in visualizing multiple data attributes, but also adapt to the behavior of the user during the data exploration stage.},

	abstract = {Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a well-known method for exploring volumetric data sets. Optical properties are assigned to the volume data and then a DVR algorithm produces visualizations by sampling volume elements and projecting them into the image plane. The mapping from voxel values to optical attribute values is known as transfer function (TF). Therefore, the quality of a visualization is highly dependent on the TF employed, but its specification is a non-trivial and unintuitive task. Without any help during the TF design process, the user goes through a frustrating and time-consuming trial-and-error cycle. This paper presents a useful combination of TF design techniques in an interactive workspace for volume visualization. Our strategy relies on semi-automatic TFs generation methods: boundary emphasis, stochastic evolutive search in TF space, and manual TF specification aided by dual domain interaction. A two-level user interface was also developed. In the first level, it provides multiple simultaneous interactive visualizations of the volume data using different TFs, while in the second one, a detailed visualization of a single TF and the respective rendered volume are displayed. Moreover, in the second level, the TF can be manually refined and the volume can be further inspected through geometric tools. The techniques combined in this work are complementary, allowing easy and fast TF design and data exploration.},

This is particularly true for multi-channel data sets, where multiple data values exist for each voxel, which requires multi-dimensional transfer functions. In this paper, we propose a new method for multi-dimensional transfer function design. Our new method provides a framework to combine multiple computational approaches and pushes the boundary of gradient-based multi-dimensional transfer functions to multiple channels, while keeping the dimensionality of transfer functions at a manageable level, i.e., a maximum of three dimensions, which can be displayed visually in a straightforward way. Our approach utilizes channel intensity, gradient, curvature and texture properties of each voxel. Applying recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms reduces the high-dimensional data of the domain. In this paper, we use Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding as well as a traditional algorithm, Principle Component Analysis. Our results show that these dimensionality reduction algorithms significantly improve the transfer function design process without compromising visualization accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new dimensionality reduction algorithms with two volumetric confocal microscopy data sets.},

The TFs are combined with common visualization techniques, such as multiplanar reformation and direct volume rendering for the evaluation of coronary arteries in MSCT image data. The presented TF-based mapping of CT values in Hounsfield Units (HU) to color and opacity leads to a different color coding for different plaque types. To account for varying HU values of the vessel lumen caused by the contrast medium, the TFs are adapted to each dataset by local histogram analysis. We describe an informal evaluation with three board-certified radiologists which indicates that the represented visualizations guide the user's attention to pathologic changes of the vessel wall as well as provide an overview about spatial variations.},

These properties are used to define a transfer-function space which enables the distinction of different materials. Additionally, we present a novel approach for interacting with our new transfer-function space which enables the design of transfer functions based on statistical properties.

The method was later extended to the case of Hilbert space [3–5], and to the case of non-quadratic functionals [6, 7].

The present paper proves the convergence of the method as applied to non-quadratic functionals, describes its extension to constrained problems, considers means for further accelerating the convergence, and describes experience in the practical application of the method for solving a variety of extremal problems.},

Modern techniques in this field have brought about a sea change in how interactive visualization and analysis of giga-, tera- and petabytes of volume data can be enabled on GPUs. In addition to combining the parallel processing power of GPUs with out-of-core methods and data streaming, a major enabler for interactivity is making both the computational and the visualization effort proportional to the amount and resolution of data that is actually visible on screen, i.e. ‘output-sensitive’ algorithms and system designs. This leads to recent output-sensitive approaches that are ‘ray-guided’, ‘visualization-driven’ or ‘display-aware’. In this survey, we focus on these characteristics and propose a new categorization of GPU-based large-scale volume visualization techniques based on the notions of actual output-resolution visibility and the current working set of volume bricks—the current subset of data that is minimally required to produce an output image of the desired display resolution. Furthermore, we discuss the differences and similarities of different rendering and data traversal strategies in volume rendering by putting them into a common context—the notion of address translation. For our purposes here, we view parallel (distributed) visualization using clusters as an orthogonal set of techniques that we do not discuss in detail but that can be used in conjunction with what we present in this survey.},

	abstract = {Volume rendering is a flexible technique for visualizing dense 3D volumetric datasets. A central element of volume rendering is the conversion between data values and observable quantities such as color and opacity. This process is usually realized through the use of transfer functions that are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. For multidimensional transfer functions applied to multivariate data, these lookup tables become prohibitively large. We propose the direct evaluation of a particular type of transfer functions based on a sum of Gaussians. Because of their simple form (in terms of number of parameters), these functions and their analytic integrals along line segments can be evaluated efficiently on current graphics hardware, obviating the need for precomputed lookup tables. We have adopted these transfer functions because they are well suited for classification based on a unique combination of multiple data values that localize features in the transfer function domain. We apply this technique to the visualization of several multivariate datasets (CT, cryosection) that are difficult to classify and render accurately at interactive rates using traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Effective 3D streamline placement and visualization play an essential role in many science and engineering disciplines. The main challenge for effective streamline visualization lies in seed placement, i.e., where to drop seeds and how many seeds should be placed. Seeding too many or too few streamlines may not reveal flow features and patterns either because it easily leads to visual clutter in rendering or it conveys little information about the flow field. Not only does the number of streamlines placed matter, their spatial relationships also play a key role in understanding the flow field. Therefore, effective flow visualization requires the streamlines to be placed in the right place and in the right amount. This paper introduces hierarchical streamline bundles, a novel approach to simplifying and visualizing 3D flow fields defined on regular grids. By placing seeds and generating streamlines according to flow saliency, we produce a set of streamlines that captures important flow features near critical points without enforcing the dense seeding condition. We group spatially neighboring and geometrically similar streamlines to construct a hierarchy from which we extract streamline bundles at different levels of detail. Streamline bundles highlight multiscale flow features and patterns through clustered yet not cluttered display. This selective visualization strategy effectively reduces visual clutter while accentuating visual foci, and therefore is able to convey the desired insight into the flow data.},

These algorithms provide greater flexibility, control and automation over traditional drawing and painting. Despite significant progress over the past 15 years, the application of NPR to the generation of stylized animations remains an active area of research. The main challenge of computer-generated stylized animations is to reproduce the look of traditional drawings and paintings while minimizing distracting flickering and sliding artefacts present in hand-drawn animations. These goals are inherently conflicting and any attempt to address the temporal coherence of stylized animations is a trade-off. This state-of-the-art report is motivated by the growing number of methods proposed in recent years and the need for a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs they propose. We formalize the problem of temporal coherence in terms of goals and compare existing methods accordingly. We propose an analysis for both line and region stylization methods and discuss initial steps towards their perceptual evaluation. The goal of our report is to help uninformed readers to choose the method that best suits their needs, as well as motivate further research to address the limitations of existing methods.},

We have developed a framework that facilitates the semi-automatic design of transfer functions. Similarly to other approaches we generate clusters in the transfer function domain. We created a real-time interaction with a hierarchy of clusters. This interaction effectively substitutes cumbersome settings of clustering thresholds. Our framework is also able to easily combine different clustering criteria. We have developed two similarity measures for clustering of material boundaries. One is based on the similarity of the boundaries in the transfer function domain and the other on their spatial relation. We use the LH space as the transfer function domain. This space facilitates the clustering of material boundaries. We demonstrate our approach on several examples.},

The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

	abstract = {Acceleration techniques for volume ray-casting are primarily based on pre-computed data structures that allow one to efficiently traverse empty or homogeneous regions. In order to display volume data that successively undergoes color lookups, however, the data structures have to be re-built continuously. In this paper we propose a technique that circumvents this drawback using hardware accelerated texture mapping. In a first rendering pass we employ graphics hardware to interactively determine for each ray where the material is hit. In a second pass ray-casting is performed, but ray traversal starts right in front of the previously determined regions. The algorithm enables interactive classification and it considerably accelerates the view dependent display of selected materials and surfaces from volume data. In contrast to other techniques that are solely based on texture mapping our approach requires less memory and accurately performs the composition of material contributions along the ray.},

	abstract = {Several existing volume rendering algorithms operate by factoring the viewing transformation into a 3D shear parallel to the data slices, a projection to form an intermediate but distorted image, and a 2D warp to form an undistorted final image. We extend this class of algorithms in three ways. First, we describe a new object-order rendering algorithm based on the factorization that is significantly faster than published algorithms with minimal loss of image quality. Shear-warp factorizations have the property that rows of voxels in the volume are aligned with rows of pixels in the intermediate image. We use this fact to construct a scanline-based algorithm that traverses the volume and the intermediate image in synchrony, taking advantage of the spatial coherence present in both. We  use spatial data structures based on run-length encoding for both the volume and the intermediate image. Our implementation running on an SGI Indigo workstation renders a 2563 voxel medical data set in one second. Our second extension is a shear-warp factorization for perspective viewing transformations, and we show how our rendering algorithm can support this extension. Third, we introduce a data structure for encoding spatial coherence in unclassified volumes (i.e. scalar fields with no precomputed opacity). When combined with our shear-warp rendering algorithm this data structure allows us to classify and render a 2563 voxel volume in three seconds. The method extends to support mixed volumes and geometry and is parallelizable.},

	url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319351.319433},
	abstract = {Splatting is a volume rendering algorithm that combines efficient volume projection with a sparse data representation: Only voxels that have values inside the iso-range need to be considered, and these voxels can be projected via efficient rasterization schemes. In splatting, each projected voxel is represented as a radially symmetric interpolation kernel, equivalent to a fuzzy ball. Projecting such a basis function leaves a fuzzy impression, called a footprint or splat, on the screen. Splatting traditionally classifies and shades the voxels prior to projection, and thus each voxel footprint is weighted by the assigned voxel color and opacity. Projecting these fuzzy color balls provides a uniform screen image for homogeneous object regions, but leads to a blurry appearance of object edges. The latter is clearly undesirable, especially when the view is zoomed on the object. In this work, we manipulate the rendering pipeline of splatting by performing the classification and shading process after the voxels have been projected onto the screen. In this way, volume contributions outside the iso-range never affect the image. Since shading requires gradients, we not only splat the density volume, using regular splats, but we also project the gradient volume, using gradient splats. However, alternative to gradient splats, we can also compute the gradients on the projection plane, using central differencing. This latter scheme cuts the number of footprint rasterization by a factor of four, since only the voxel densities have to be projected. Our new method renders objects with crisp edges and well-preserved surface detail. Added overhead is the calculation of the screen gradients and the per-pixel shading. Both of these operations, however, may be performed using fast techniques employing lookup tables.},

The other one is Optimal Control, which was organized byK. {\textasciitilde}Teo and L. Caccetta for the Dynamic Control Congress, Ottawa, 1999. This volume is divided into three parts: Optimal Control; Optimization Methods; and Applications. The Optimal Control part is concerned with com putational methods, modeling and nonlinear systems. Three computational methods for solving optimal control problems are presented: (i) a regularization method for computing ill-conditioned optimal control problems, (ii) penalty function methods that appropriately handle final state equality constraints, and (iii) a multilevel optimization approach for the numerical solution of opti mal control problems. In the fourth paper, the worst-case optimal regulation involving linear time varying systems is formulated as a minimax optimal con trol problem.},

Solving continuous optimization problems is a fundamental task in computational mathematics for applications in areas of engineering, economics, chemistry, biology and so on. Most real problems are nonlinear and can be of quite large size. Devel oping efficient algorithms for continuous optimization has been an important field of research in the last 30 years, with much additional impetus provided in the last decade by the availability of very fast and parallel computers. Techniques, like the simplex method, that were already considered fully developed thirty years ago have been thoroughly revised and enormously improved. The aim of this ASI was to present the state of the art in this field. While not all important aspects could be covered in the fifty hours of lectures (for instance multiob jective optimization had to be skipped), we believe that most important topics were presented, many of them by scientists who greatly contributed to their development.},

In our applications, evaluations of the objective function typically require minutes or hours, so it becomes attractive to use more than the standard three steps in the subdivision, performing the evaluations in parallel. A statistical model for this scenario is presented giving the total execution time T in terms of the number of steps k and the probability distribution for the individual evaluation times. Both the model and extensive simulations show that the expected value of T does not fall monotonically with k, in fact more steps may significantly increase the execution time. We propose heuristics for speeding convergence by continuing to the next iteration before all evaluations are complete. Simulations are used to estimate the speedup achieved.},

Experimental Design: From User Studies to Psychophysics is an accessible introduction to psychological experiments and experimental design, covering the major components in the design, execution, and analysis of perceptual studies. The book begins with an introduction to the concepts central to designing and understanding experiments, including developing a research question, setting conditions and controls, and balancing specificity with generality. The book then explores in detail a number of types of experimental tasks: free description, rating scales, forced-choice, specialized multiple choice, and real-world tasks as well as physiological studies. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each type and provides examples of that type of experiment from the authors own work. The book also covers stimulus-related issues, including popular stimulus resources. It concludes with a thorough examination of statistical techniques for analyzing results, including methods specific to individual tasks.},

These irregularly-spaced locations, hence referred to as “data points,” may have diverse meanings: in meterology, weather observation stations; in geography, surveyed locations; in city and regional planning, centers of data-collection zones; in biology, observation locations. It is assumed that a unique number (such as rainfall in meteorology, or altitude in geography) is associated with each data point. In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly. Interpolated values over a fine grid may then be evaluated. In using such a function it is assumed that the original data are without error, or that compensation for error will be made after interpolation.},

The application of LIC to 3D flow fields has yet been limited by difficulties to efficiently display and animate the resulting 3D-images. Texture-based volume rendering allows interactive visualization and manipulation of 3D-LIC textures. In order to ensure the comprehensive and convenient exploration of flow fields, we suggest interactive functionality including transfer functions and different clipping mechanisms. Thereby, we efficiently substitute the calculation of LIC based on sparse noise textures and show the convenient visual access of interior structures. Further on, we introduce two approaches for animating static 3D-flow fields without the computational expense and the immense memory requirements for pre-computed 3D-textures and without loss of interactivity. This is achieved by using a single 3D-LIC texture and a set of time surfaces as clipping geometries. In our first approach we use the clipping geometry to pre-compute a special 3D-LIC texture that can be animated by time-dependent color tables. Our second approach uses time volumes to actually clip the 3D-LIC volume interactively during rasterization. Additionally, several examples demonstrate the value of our strategy in practice.},

These drawbacks, coupled with our need for realistic anatomical volume rendering for teaching and surgical planning, has motivated us to explore the auto-generation of color maps that combine natural colorization with the perceptual discriminating capacity of grayscale. As evidenced by the examples shown that have been created by the algorithm described, the merging of perceptually accurate and realistically colorized virtual anatomy appears to insightfully interpret and impartially enhance volume rendered patient data.},

In general, transfer functions are generated in a transfer function space, which is the feature space constructed by data values and properties derived from the data. If volumetric objects have the same or overlapping data values, it would be difficult to separate them in the transfer function space. In this paper, we present a rule-enhanced transfer function design method that allows important structures of the volume to be more effectively separated and highlighted. We define a set of rules based on the local frequency distribution of volume attributes. A rule-selection method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to learn the set of rules that can distinguish the user-specified target tissue from other tissues. In the rendering stage, voxels satisfying these rules are rendered with higher opacities in order to highlight the target tissue. The proposed method was tested on various volumetric datasets to enhance the visualization of important structures that are difficult to be visualized by traditional transfer function design methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We have found frequency distributions to contain meaningful and quantitative information that is relevant for many kinds of feature queries. Our approach allows users to enter predicate-based hypotheses about relational patterns in local distributions and render visualizations that show how neighborhoods match the predicates. Distributions are a familiar concept to nonexpert users, and we have built a simple graphical user interface for forming and testing queries interactively. The query framework readily applies to arbitrary spatial data sets and supports queries on time variant and multifield data. Users can directly query for classes of features previously inaccessible in general feature detection tools. Using several well-known data sets, we show new quantitative features that enhance our understanding of familiar visualization results.},

Implementations that use the 2D-texture capabilities of standard PC hardware, usually render object-aligned slices in order to substitute trilinear by bilinear interpolation. However the resulting images often contain visual artifacts caused by the lack of spatial interpolation. In this paper we propose new rendering techniques that significantly improve both performance and image quality of the 2D-texture based approach. We will show how in ulti-texturing capabilitiesof modern consumer PC graphboards are exploited to enable in teractive high quality volume visualization on low-cost hardware.

	title = {Enhanced perception in volume visualization},
	url = {http://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/10803/117524},
	abstract = {Due to the nature of scientic data sets, the generation of convenient visualizations may be a difficult task, but crucial to correctly convey the relevant information of the data. When working with complex volume models, such as the anatomical ones, it is important to provide accurate representations, since a misinterpretation can lead to serious mistakes while diagnosing a disease or planning surgery. In these cases, enhancing the perception of the features of interest usually helps to properly understand the data.
Throughout years, researchers have focused on different methods to improve the visualization of volume data sets. For instance, the definition of good transfer functions is a key issue in Volume Visualization, since transfer functions determine how materials are classified. Other approaches are based on simulating realistic illumination models to enhance the spatial perception, or using illustrative effects to provide the level of abstraction needed to correctly interpret the data.
This thesis contributes with new approaches to enhance the visual and spatial perception in Volume Visualization. Thanks to the new computing capabilities of modern graphics hardware, the proposed algorithms are capable of modifying the illumination model and simulating illustrative motifs in real time.
In order to enhance local details, which are useful to better perceive the shape and the surfaces of the volume, our first contribution is an algorithm that employs a common sharpening operator to modify the lighting applied. As a result, the overall contrast of the visualization is enhanced by brightening the salient features and darkening the deeper regions of the volume model.
The enhancement of depth perception in Direct Volume Rendering is also covered in the thesis. To do this, we propose two algorithms to simulate ambient occlusion: a screen-space technique based on using depth information to estimate the amount of light occluded, and a view-independent method that uses the density values of the data set to estimate the occlusion. Additionally, depth perception is also enhanced by adding halos around the structures of interest.
Maximum Intensity Projection images provide a good understanding of the high intensity features of the data, but lack any contextual information. In order to enhance the depth perception in such a case, we present a novel technique based on changing how intensity is accumulated. Furthermore, the perception of the spatial arrangement of the displayed structures is also enhanced by adding certain colour cues.
The last contribution is a new manipulation tool designed for adding contextual information when cutting the volume. Based on traditional illustrative effects, this method allows the user to directly extrude structures from the cross-section of the cut. As a result, the clipped structures are displayed at different heights, preserving the information needed to correctly perceive them.},

In this paper we present a new editing technique based on the use of clipping planes, direct structure extrusion, and illustrative methods, which preserves the context by adapting the extruded region to the structures of interest of the volumetric model. We will show that users may interactively modify the clipping plane and edit the structures to highlight, in order to easily create the desired result. Our approach works with segmented volume models and non-segmented ones. In the last case, a local segmentation is performed on-the-fly. We will demonstrate the efficiency and utility of our method.},

While transparency or cutaways can be used to reveal a focus object, these techniques remove parts of the context information. Exploded views, on the other hand, do not suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a force-based model: the volume is divided into a part configuration controlled by a number of forces and constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force causing the parts to arrange according to the given constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach allows for a wide variety of explosion-based visualizations including view-dependent explosions.

	abstract = {There are many “machine vision” models of the visual saliency mechanism, which controls the process of selecting and allocating attention to the most “prominent” locations in the scene and helps humans interact with the visual environment efficiently (Itti and C. Koch, 2001; Gao et al., 2000). It is important to know which models perform the best in mimicking the saliency mechanism of the human visual system. There are several metrics to compare saliency models; however, results from different metrics vary widely in evaluating models. In this paper, a procedure is proposed for evaluating metrics for comparing saliency maps using a database of human fixations on approximately 1000 images. This procedure is then employed to identify the best metric. This best metric is then used to evaluate ten published bottom-up saliency models. An optimized level of the blurriness and center-bias is found for each visual saliency model. Performance of the models is also analyzed on a dataset of 54 synthetic images.},

Commodity desktop hardware has struggled to keep pace with data size increases, challenging modern visualization software to deliver responsive interactions for O(N3) algorithms such as volume rendering. We target the data type common in these domains: regularly-structured data. In this work, we demonstrate that the major limitation of most volume rendering approaches is their inability to switch the data sampling rate (and thus data size) quickly. Using a volume renderer inspired by recent work, we demonstrate that the actual amount of visualizable data for a scene is typically bound considerably lower than the memory available on a commodity GPU. Our instrumented renderer is used to investigate design decisions typically swept under the rug in volume rendering literature. The renderer is freely available, with binaries for all major platforms as well as full source code, to encourage reproduction and comparison with future research.},

However, determining an ideal transfer function is still a challenging task because of the lack of measurable metrics for quality of volume visualization. In the paper, we presented the voxel vibility model as a quality metric to design the desired visibility for voxels instead of designing transfer functions directly. Transfer functions are obtained by minimizing the distance between the desired visibility distribution and the actual visibility distribution. The voxel model is a mapping function from the feature attributes of voxels to the visibility of voxels. To consider between-class information and with-class information simultaneously, the voxel visibility model is described as a Gaussian mixture model. To highlight the important features, the matched result can be obtained by changing the parameters in the voxel visibility model through a simple and effective interface. Simultaneously, we also proposed an algorithm for transfer functions optimization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experimental results on several volumetric data sets.},

Despite the numerous examples of sophisticated 3D rendering techniques, domain experts, who still prefer slice-based visualization do not consider these to be very useful. Since 3D renderings have the advantage of providing an overview at a glance, while 2D depictions better serve detailed analyses, it is of general interest to better combine these methods. Recently there have been attempts to bridge this gap between 2D and 3D renderings. These attempts include specialized techniques for volume picking in medical imaging data that result in repositioning slices. In this paper, we present a new volume picking technique called WYSIWYP (“what you see is what you pick”) that, in contrast to previous work, does not require pre-segmented data or metadata and thus is more generally applicable. The positions picked by our method are solely based on the data itself, the transfer function, and the way the volumetric rendering is perceived by the user. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we apply it to automated positioning of slices in volumetric scalar fields from various application areas. Finally, we present results of a user study in which 3D locations selected by users are compared to those resulting from WYSIWYP. The user study confirms our claim that the resulting positions correlate well with those perceived by the user.},

In this paper, we first propose the human-centric boundary extraction criteria and our boundary model. Based on the model we present a boundary visualization method through a what material you pick is what boundary you see approach. Users can pick out the material of interest to directly convey semantics. In addition, the 3-D canny edge detection is utilized to ensure the good localization of boundaries. Furthermore, we establish a point-to-material distance measure to guarantee the accuracy and integrity of boundaries.

	abstract = {Manual opacity transfer function editing for volume rendering can be a difficult and counter-intuitive process. This paper proposes a logarithmically scaled editor, and argues that such a scale relates the height of the transfer function to the rendered intensity of a region of particular density in the volume almost directly, resulting in much improved, simpler manual transfer function editing.},
